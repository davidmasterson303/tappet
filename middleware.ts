/**
 * Route protection.
 *
 * This is a UX and defence-in-depth layer, not the security boundary. The real
 * enforcement lives in RLS and in `lib/api-auth.ts` — middleware exists so a
 * signed-out visitor lands on /login instead of an empty, broken page.
 *
 * The routing policy is deliberately split into a pure function
 * (`resolveRoute`) so it can be unit tested against the real implementation.
 * Before this, `security.test.ts` tested a private copy of this logic while the
 * exported middleware was a no-op with an empty matcher — 11 green tests
 * asserting protection the app did not actually have.
 *
 * That policy now lives in `@wellkept/core/routes` so `components/AuthProvider.tsx`
 * can share it — a client component cannot import this module, which pulls in
 * `next/server`. It is re-exported below rather than duplicated, because a
 * private copy of this logic is the exact bug described above.

        Next 13.5.1: neither `set` nor `append` sticks. The preflight above
        does carry `Vary: Origin`, because that response is constructed here
        and never passes through the router.

        Why it is acceptable rather than fixed: these responses embed a
        specific Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so in principle a shared cache
        that did not know they vary by Origin could serve one origin's
        response to another. In practice the routes are `force-dynamic` and
        the deployment returns `cache-control: no-cache` on them, so no shared
        cache may reuse a response without revalidating.

        `append` is kept rather than `set` so this starts working on its own if
        Next stops overwriting. Do not read the header on a passthrough
        response and conclude it is configured — it is not.

 *

 * middleware is killed when the response is returned, so a bare

    ── But it is weaker HERE than its unit tests suggest, measured 3 Aug ──────

    **Next 13.5 strips its own `next-router-prefetch` and `RSC` headers before
    middleware runs.** Verified by logging every header this function receives
    during a prefetch-shaped request: `accept`, `host`, `user-agent`, and
    nothing else. A custom `Sec-Purpose` or `purpose` *does* arrive, which is
    why two of the three signals work and Next's own does not.

    So `isPrefetchRequest` is green in its suite and partly inert in this
    position — the precise shape this file's own docstring records from
    `security.test.ts`: a test asserting protection the app does not have.
    Written down rather than deleted, because the check is correct in the route
    handler, correct for browser speculative loads (`Sec-Purpose`), and would
    start working here if Next stops stripping.

    **What actually protects the top of the funnel today:** nothing links to
    `/check` with prefetching on. A Next `<Link>` prefetch is a client `fetch()`
    that carries no browser prefetch header, so it is undetectable from here —
    which makes `prefetch={false}` on any future link to this route a
    correctness requirement, not a preference. `front-door-gate.test.ts`
    asserts it.
