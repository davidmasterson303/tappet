 * app does not yet know whether anyone is signed in. Rendering the sign-in
 * screen during that window would flash a login form at a signed-in user on
 * every cold start — `hooks/useVehicles.ts` carries the web version of this
 * lesson, where a query fired before the session resolved and cached an empty
 * garage.
 *
 * So `undefined` means "still asking" and renders nothing but a spinner.
 *
 * ── The type gate, which is the same argument one layer down ────────────────
 *
 * Fonts load asynchronously too, and a screen painted before they arrive draws
 * in San Francisco and then **reflows** when Inter lands — every metric on the
 * screen shifts at once, a frame or two after the user is already reading. That
 * is worse than the wait it avoids, and worst on the dense screens.
 *
 * ⚠ The two gates are deliberately **not** merged into one condition. They fail
 * differently: an unresolved session is a question with an answer coming, while
 * a font that will not load is a permanent state — and treating that as "still
 * loading" would hang the app on a blank screen forever. See `fontState`.
