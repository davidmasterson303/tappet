/**
 * Suggestions this owner has said no to.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Why this is on the device and not in the database ─────────────────────
 *
 * A declined rung is **a preference about what to show**, not a fact about the
 * car. Nothing downstream reads it: the health score, the dossier, the recall
 * list and the wishlist are all unchanged by it, and the ladder recomputes from
 * `vehicle_knowledge_base.common_mods` every time either way. Storing an
 * opinion about a list in a table that describes a vehicle would be the first
 * step towards something else reading it as a fact about the vehicle.
 *
 * It is also what makes "Not for me" shippable at all this round. A server-side
 * decline is a new `/api/v1` route, and per `CLAUDE.md` §8 a mobile build that
 * depends on a new route has to wait for a `web-live` promote. Device storage
 * makes the whole feature a JS change.
 *
 * ⚠ **What that costs, stated rather than discovered:** declines do not sync.
 * Sign in on a second phone and the suggestion is back. That is the honest
 * trade for a preference — and it is genuinely the right side of it for
 * something a person can undo in one tap on the screen it appears on. If
 * declines ever need to travel, they need a table and a route, and this module
 * is the one place that changes.
 *
 * ── `secureStorage`, for something that is not a secret ─────────────────────
 *
 * The same argument `first-run-storage.ts` makes: it is the persistence this
 * app already has. Adding `AsyncStorage` for a list of strings would be a
 * second mechanism to keep working, on the platform where a second one is
 * banned outright — `mobile-api-only.test.ts` forbids `AsyncStorage`, because a
 * refresh token once lived in it.
 *
 * ── Failure reads as "nothing declined", and that direction is deliberate ───
 *
 * A read that fails shows the owner a suggestion they may have dismissed, which
 * is a small annoyance they can fix in one tap. The other direction hides a
 * recommendation the product exists to make, silently and permanently, because
 * of a storage error nobody would ever see.
