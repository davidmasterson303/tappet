/**
 * Contrast measured on a **rendered** screen, not on a colour literal.
 *
 * ── What the source scan cannot see ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lib/__tests__/mobile-text-contrast.test.ts` reads every `color:
 * 'rgba(255,255,255,α)'` out of the StyleSheets and checks α against the AA
 * floor. That found nine sub-floor styles and was worth writing, but it is a
 * proxy in three ways it cannot fix:
 *
 *   - **A colour that is not a literal is invisible to it.** `healthBandHex()`
 *     returns one, and any conditional or prop-driven style produces one. The
 *     scan sees a function call.
 *   - **It cannot know what is actually behind the text.** It assumes the
 *     screen background. A card, an inset panel or the white advisor CTA is a
 *     different backdrop, and the same colour passes on one and fails on
 *     another.
 *   - **It cannot know which styles are applied together.** React Native
 *     merges arrays and later entries win; the scan reads each declaration in
 *     isolation.
 *
 * This walks the tree a screen actually produced, flattens each `Text`'s style
 * the way the platform does, and measures the result.
 *
 * ── Why the scan is kept as well ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It runs on every `npm test` from the repo root and covers **every** style in
 * the app, including ones on screens no render test mounts. This covers fewer
 * styles, far more truthfully. Neither is a superset of the other.
 */

/**
 * Every Well Kept screen renders on this.
 *
 * ⚠ **Moved from `#080808` to `#100F0D` on 14 Aug** with the v8 token layer.
 * The old value was a flat neutral black this app invented; `surface.page` is
 * the warm graphite web has always used, and the two clients looking like two
 * products was largely this one literal, repeated 27 times.
 *
 * **It is lighter**, so every light-on-dark ratio measured here got slightly
 * *worse* — this constant is the backdrop the whole suite composites against,
 * so a stale value here would report ratios the app never renders. Changing it
 * is the point: anything that fails now was already failing on the device.
 *
 * Not imported from `../theme` on purpose. A harness that reads the value it is
 * checking cannot detect the value being wrong — it would agree with any drift.
 * These two must be kept equal by hand, and `theme-backdrop.test.ts` fails if
 * they are not.

 * Since `d6fbae8` it composites parent `opacity`, which makes it *more*
 * accurate than a scan of colour literals — and it means it will flag disabled
 * controls that **WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.3 explicitly exempts**:
 *
 *   "User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction
 *   (e.g., a disabled control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast
 *   requirements."
 *
 * Verified against the W3C Understanding document rather than recalled. The two
 * buttons that first run found — the Advisor's "Ask" at 1.61:1 and SignIn's
 * submit at ~1.85:1 — were both **disabled states**, and the commit that fixed
 * them described them as failures "against a 4.5 floor". That overstated it.
 * They were worth fixing on product grounds: a primary action nobody can read
 * leaves you unable to tell what the control even is, and the sign-in button is
 * the state that screen *opens* in. But the standard did not require it.
 *
 * So read a failure here as **a rule this project chose**, not as a compliance
 * defect — and do not let a red result here be used to argue that the app is
 * inaccessible, or a green one to claim more than it proves. The web guard
 * `lib/__tests__/text-contrast-floor.test.ts` draws the exemption line

    `opacity` on a `View` fades its whole subtree toward whatever is behind it,

    measured at its *undimmed* colour and passed at a ratio it does not
    achieve. Found by mutation: the wishlist's disabled CTA was dropped from

    tests stayed green.

    Accumulated multiplicatively down the tree, because nested faded groups
    compound.

    group opacity flattens a subtree and composites it *once*; this applies the
    factor to each layer as it descends. For the shape that actually occurs —
    a solid fill with text on it — the two agree. They diverge when translucent
    layers are stacked inside a faded group, where this reads slightly darker

    ⚠ What this costs, stated rather than discovered: an element that is

    captures a non-zero `prevActScopeDepth`, takes the branch that skips
    `flushActQueue`, and leaves its render work sitting in a queue nobody
    drains. Nothing throws; the root is simply never committed.

    `jest.setup.js` fails the test that leaks the scope. This catches the same
