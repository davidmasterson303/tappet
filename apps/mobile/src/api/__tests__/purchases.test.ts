/**
 * Reporting a purchase to the server.
 *
 * Phase 6, E8. The mapping from status to verdict is tested in
 * `purchase-flow.test.ts`, beside the route contract it mirrors. What is tested
 * here is the part that only exists on the device: which failures mean Apple
 * declined something, and which mean nothing was ever asked.
 *
 * The distinction matters because the money has already left before this
 * function is called. A failure reported as "we could not confirm your
 * purchase" when the request was never sent invites somebody to buy it twice.
