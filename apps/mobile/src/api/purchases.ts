/**
 * Turning a completed StoreKit purchase into an entitlement.
 *
 * Phase 6, E8. StoreKit hands the app a signed transaction; this sends it to
 * `POST /api/v1/iap/verify`, which is the only place the association between a
 * subscription and a Well Kept account is ever made.
 *
 * ── Why this returns an outcome instead of throwing ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Every other call in this folder throws `ApiRequestError` and lets the screen
 * decide. That is right when the failure means "the thing did not happen".
 * Here the money has already left the customer's account before this function
 * is called, so *every* status is a state the screen has to handle carefully —
 * a 503 is not an error to surface, it is "we have your purchase and are still
 * writing it down".
 *
 * Collapsing those into a thrown error would push that distinction into a
 * `catch` block, where the difference between "declined" and "paid but not yet
 * recorded" is exactly the difference between a customer who buys again and one
 * who does not.
 *
 * The mapping itself lives in `@wellkept/core/purchase-flow` beside the route
 * contract it mirrors, so the two cannot drift in separate files.
