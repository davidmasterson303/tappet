/**
 * Adding a photograph of the car, from the phone.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `uploadVehiclePhoto` is a Next server action on the cookie session, so the
 * phone could never reach it. Until 15 Aug there was no way to add a vehicle
 * photograph from the app at all — which made the identity plate the only
 * reachable state, and a plate you cannot replace is a dead end rather than a
 * fallback. `POST /api/v1/upload-photo` is the bearer route built for it.
 *
 * ── The two checks that happen here rather than at the server ───────────────
 *
 * Both are also enforced server-side and neither is trusted from here — they
 * exist so the common refusals cost nothing. A phone on cellular should not
 * spend a megabyte discovering that the file was a megabyte too big.
