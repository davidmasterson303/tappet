 *
 * ── Sign-up lives here rather than on its own screen ────────────────────────
 *
 * Added 8 Aug, when the product went mobile-first. Until then this screen could
 * only sign in, so the only way to become a user was the web app — fatal for
 * something sold on the App Store, where a reviewer downloads the app and has
 * no route to the product.
 *
 * One form, two modes, because the fields are identical and the difference is a
 * verb. A separate screen would duplicate the inputs, the keyboard handling and
 * the error surface to change one label and one call.

 * stall the moment the session lapses, and there is nobody there to tap — the
 * session died mid-test on 5 Aug and blocked a verification run outright.
 *
 * It runs **once per launch**, only in a dev build, and only when
 * `apps/mobile/.env` supplies credentials. Absent that file, nothing here does
 * anything and this screen is exactly what it always was.
 *
 * ── It is never silent ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An app that signs itself in with no explanation is indistinguishable from one
 * that ignored a sign-out, so it says what it is doing and reports a failure
 * with the reason. A wrong password in `.env` and an unreachable auth server
 * look identical otherwise, and nobody is watching to tell them apart.
 *
 * To test the real sign-in form, remove the two variables from `.env`.

 * `SignedInScreen` that used to render it, and it sat as dead code until
 * 5 Aug. This screen is the right home precisely because it is the one that
 * renders **before** a session exists: none of what core computes depends on
 * being signed in, so gating the probe behind sign-in would have made it
 * unrunnable exactly when a bundle is most broken.
 *
 * ── Why a summary line and not a list ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A permanently-expanded panel of green rows is furniture — it stops being read
 * within a day, which is how the *previous* home stopped being noticed. One
 * line that says `4/4` is glanceable, and a failure is the only thing that
 * needs detail, so a failure expands itself and cannot be collapsed away.
 *
 * ── `__DEV__` only, same rule as `DevToken` ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A diagnostic, not a product surface. A release build compiles this out, and

 * is rendered at all — being deleted from the tree is how it became dead code
 * the first time.
