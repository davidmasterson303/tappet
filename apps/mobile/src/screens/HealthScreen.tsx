/**
 * The score, and everything behind it.
 *
 * ── Why this is a screen and not three cards on the vehicle hub ─────────────
 *
 * `VehicleDetailScreen` carried the dial, the summary, the three drivers and
 * the history chart, plus a build dial, a ladder and five detail rows. David's
 * note on 23 Aug: *"really, the whole information architecture is unclear,
 * cluttered, uninspired and confusing."*
 *
 * The design system agrees and says why —
 * `specs/native-vehicle-detail.spec.html` is **"a hub, not tabs"**: the vehicle
 * screen names a car and lists places to go, and *"every section is a real
 * pushed route with a real back gesture … on a phone a stack is the better
 * shape, because each destination gets the full screen and the platform's own
 * back."*
 *
 * So the reading stays on the hub — one dial, one word, one sentence — and the
 * *account of it* lives here, where there is room for the drivers to have their
 * explanations and the chart to be a chart.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The hero dial, and this is the screen that earns it ───────────────────
 *
 * The board's rule is *"one dial per screen"* and puts the 184pt hero on the
 * garage bay. The vehicle hub therefore takes the 104pt card dial — a second
 * hero on it would be a second screen claiming the same instrument. Here there
 * is exactly one dial and it is the subject, so it is drawn at hero size.
 *
 * ── The drivers do not add up to the score, and are not presented as if ─────
 *
 * `health_score` comes from the model; the three drivers are computed from the
 * schedule, the recall list and mileage against age. They explain the subject
 * without summing to it, which is why they sit **below** the summary rather
 * than beside the dial — three numbers next to a total invite arithmetic that
 * does not hold.

          three times out of three on 5 Aug — and exactly **one** screen
          consumed it. A `device` 401 is genuinely signed out; a `server` 401
          may be a token the server would accept a second later, and destroying
          a working session over one response is how a spurious failure becomes
          a forced re-login.

        worst one — which made it a third path to the same two items.

        ⚠ It keeps its own component and its own fetch rather than being folded

        the severity banners and the NHTSA-not-checked state, all of which are

        Two problems, and the second is the one that made it a finding. It was a
        hand-written paraphrase of the health disclosure, so the phone and the

        `advice-disclosure.ts` exists to prevent and that

        the whole of UX-16: "an assessment from what we know" describes a
        process without naming the thing doing it.

        The inputs it listed are not lost. `HealthDrivers` sits directly above
