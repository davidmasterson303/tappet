/**
 * Phase 3.2 — the garage, read only.
 *
 * One request to `GET /api/v1/vehicles`, which already returns everything this
 * screen draws: the declared garage columns, a **signed** `photo_url`, the
 * health summary and the recall list. No second call, and nothing derived on
 * the device that the server already knows.
 *
 * ── Why the health band is imported and not written here ────────────────────
 *
 * `@wellkept/core/health-band` holds the thresholds and the wording. The web
 * dashboard reads the same module. A local copy of "80 is good" would drift
 * from the web silently — the two-components bug that produced that module in
 * the first place, at two-clients scale, where nobody notices until a phone and
 * a laptop are held side by side.
 *
 * Since step 4 this screen no longer paints a score itself. `ClusterGauge`'s
 * row variant owns the presentation and reads the band internally; the band is
 * still resolved here because the card needs to know whether there *is* a
 * score at all — a missing score is not a zero, and banding one would paint the
 * card red about a condition nobody measured.
 *
 * ── The states this has to render ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four, and the last two are the ones usually skipped. Loading and loaded are
 * obvious. **401** means the session died under us and the answer is not an
 * error box — `App.tsx` will swap to the sign-in screen the moment the session
 * clears, so this reports it plainly and lets that happen. **Empty** is not a
 * failure: an account with no cars is the ordinary first-run state, and showing
 * "something went wrong" there is how a working app looks broken.

        ── The garage is a row of bays, swiped between ──────────────────────────

        A **vertical** scroller carrying the header and pull-to-refresh, with a
        **horizontal** paged scroller of bays inside it. Both directions are
        needed and a single list cannot give them: a horizontal `FlatList` puts
        its `ListHeaderComponent` to the *left* of the first item rather than
        above it, and `RefreshControl` only works on a vertical scroller.

        A paged `ScrollView` rather than a horizontal `FlatList`, deliberately.
        A garage is a handful of cars — virtualisation buys nothing at that size
        and costs the thing that matters here, which is that every bay is
        mounted and only the focused one animates. `active` is what gates the
        door and the needle; a virtualised list would instead have bays igniting
        as they scrolled into the window, which is three intros for one glance.
