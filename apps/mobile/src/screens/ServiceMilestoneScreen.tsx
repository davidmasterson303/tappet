/**
 * Phase 5.6 — where a service-due notification lands.
 *
 * ── Confirm, then assert, with provenance. All three ────────────────────────
 *
 * David's decision, 7 Aug. The schedule comes from a model and the odometer is
 * user-reported, so the screen opens on **the mileage it is about to reason
 * from** rather than asserting a milestone over an unverified number. Confirm
 * or correct, then the answer.
 *
 * That ordering is not politeness. Every figure below is derived from the
 * reading, so a stale odometer does not make the screen slightly wrong — it
 * makes it confidently wrong, which is the failure mode a notification cannot
 * afford.
 *
 * ── Why the provenance label is not decoration ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This app has shipped unsubstantiated provenance claims twice, and
 * `provenance-claims.test.ts` exists because of it. Every label here derives
 * from `evaluateSchedule`'s own `evidence` field, and a milestone takes the
 * weakest claim its services can jointly support — because a reader takes "from
 * your service records" as covering the lot.
 *
 * Three rungs since Track A2a, not two: records, then what the owner told us at
 * sign-up, then a bare estimate. The middle one exists because an invoice is a
 * document and a recollection is not, and collapsing them would make the app
 * cite a memory as a record. The label is rendered by lookup, so a fourth rung
 * would appear here without an edit — `isServiceBasis` is what stops an
 * unrecognised one drawing a blank chip.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately not here ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing books an appointment. The wishlist is the action: it is what the
 * advisor prices, and adding a job to it is the step that actually leads
 * somewhere in this product.

    due was on the other side of answering it. The review's general rule came
    out of this exact screen — **no screen exists whose only content is one
    question.** It is a sheet, a banner, or an inline edit.

    So the schedule renders either way and the question sits above it. Two taps
    become one for anyone whose odometer has not changed, and somebody who
    ignores the banner still sees what their car needs — computed from the last
    reading, which is the honest thing to compute it from and is what the
    banner says.

    ⚠ **It is not dismissible, and that is deliberate.** The reading is what
