            This screen sold **an allowance**. The headline was "More room for
            the advisor" and the lede said the paid tier *"raises that allowance
            five times over"* — which was also wrong: 400,000 → 1,000,000 output
            tokens is **2.5×**, a misleading claim about what a subscription buys
            made inside the binary, which is Guideline 2.3.1 territory.

            Deriving the figure from `TIERS` fixed the arithmetic and left the
            deeper problem: *nobody can tell what they are buying*. A monthly
            token allowance is a unit the customer has never seen, cannot observe
            while using the app, and cannot relate to their own use.

            The pricing decision of 24 Aug replaces it with a feature gate, so
            there is **no multiple to state** and the sentence is deleted rather
            than repaired. `entitlementMultiple()` exists only to keep that copy
            honest and now has no caller.

            ⚠ The list is rendered from `paid-features.ts` rather than written
            here. The gate the server enforces and the promise this screen makes
            are then the same object — a hand-written list on a paywall is a
            second source of truth for what somebody just paid for, and the one
            that drifts is always the one the customer read.
