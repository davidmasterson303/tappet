/**
 * Phase 5.6 — where a recall notification lands.
 *
 * Replaces the placeholder on `VehicleDetailScreen`, which said "Recall detail
 * is on the web for now."
 *
 * ── Why this exists rather than the advisor ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The notification used to open the advisor with the question pre-typed, and
 * that was a reasonable answer to "explain this". David's call on 7 Aug was that
 * the point of the alert is to drive an action, not only to explain — so the
 * destination is a screen with the notice, what it means, and what to do about
 * it, and the advisor is one of the things you can do from it.
 *
 * ── The severity banner is the whole reason this is not a list ──────────────
 *
 * NHTSA sends `parkIt` and `parkOutSide`. A `do-not-drive` recall is not a
 * maintenance item and must not be rendered as one — the banner is the first
 * thing on the screen, before the vehicle name, because someone who opens this
 * from a notification needs the instruction before the context.
 *
 * ── Absent fields, which are the normal case here ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The stored payloads predate `Remedy` — see `recalls.ts`. Every section asks
 * before it draws. A "How it gets fixed" heading over an empty box reads as
 * "nobody knows how to fix this", which is a worse claim than staying quiet.

        how the match was made, so it is as true of "no recalls found" as it is
        of three — and the empty case is where an owner is most likely to take
        it as a statement about their specific car.
