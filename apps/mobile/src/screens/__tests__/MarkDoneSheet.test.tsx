/**
 * The sheet that writes permanent service history.
 *
 * ── Why this was worth writing before anything else touched the screen ──────
 *
 * It had **no behavioural tests at all**. `contrast.test.tsx` mounts it through
 * the wishlist and measures its colours, and that was the whole net — on the
 * one surface in this product that writes into a car's permanent history and
 * deletes the wishlist row, with no undo.
 *
 * That gap was load-bearing on 16 Aug: migrating this screen onto the primitive
 * set, I deliberately left two compound controls hand-rolled rather than
 * reshape a form I could not verify. These are what make the next change to it
 * a normal change.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately *not* covered here ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The validation rules themselves. `completionProblems` decides what is wrong
 * and `wishlist-completion.test.ts` owns that; re-asserting "a future date is
 * refused" here would test the same judgement twice and pin it to a screen it
 * does not belong to. These cover what the **screen** does with the answer:
 * when it shows a problem, what it refuses to send, and what it hands over.
