 * and the difficulties reach the screen at all*, because the defect was never a
 * missing feature. It was a component discarding four fifths of its input, and
 * nothing failed.

 * to a wishlist, decline them — plus the two states this product is careful
 * about: a dial at rest is **stock, not broken**, and a lookup that has not run
 * is not the same as nothing to suggest.
