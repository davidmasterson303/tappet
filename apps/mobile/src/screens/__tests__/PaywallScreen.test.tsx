/**
 * The screen where somebody spends money.
 *
 * Two classes of failure are worth the whole file. One is telling a customer
 * something the app does not know — that they are subscribed, or that a
 * completed payment failed. The other is a compliance miss that App Review
 * catches instead of us: guideline 3.1.2 wants the renewal terms and both legal
 * links in the binary, and a restore path to exist.
 *
 * The purchase *decisions* are tested in `purchase-flow.test.ts`. What is
 * tested here is that the screen renders the resolver's answer and never
 * substitutes its own.
