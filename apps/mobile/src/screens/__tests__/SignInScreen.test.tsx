/**
 * The front door.
 *
 * This is the first screen an App Store reviewer sees and, since 8 Aug, the
 * only place a person can become a Well Kept user at all — the web no longer
 * carries enrollment. A defect here is not a degraded experience, it is a
 * product nobody can enter.
 *
 * It had no behaviour coverage. `contrast.test.tsx` mounts it and measures its
 * colours, which proves it renders and says nothing about what it does.
 *
 * ── What is mocked, and what deliberately is not ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `auth/session` is mocked at the `signIn`/`signUp` boundary — those call
 * Supabase, and the thing worth testing is which one this screen calls, with
 * what, and what it does with each shape of answer.
 *
 * The **mode switch is not mocked at all**, because it is state in this
 * component and it is where the interesting bug lives: a screen that reads
 * "Create account" while calling `signIn` looks completely correct in a
 * screenshot.
 *
 * `userEvent` throughout, never `fireEvent` — see `AddVehicleScreen.test.tsx`
 * for why the latter silently does nothing under React 19's concurrent render.
