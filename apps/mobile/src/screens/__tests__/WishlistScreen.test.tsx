/**
 * The wishlist, on the phone.
 *
 * Phase 5.6. Two things here have a history of going wrong quietly, and both
 * are what this suite is really for.
 *
 * ── The identifier ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `@wellkept/core/wishlist-identifier` exists because three call sites once
 * built the identifier three different ways, and produced duplicate rows, an
 * "already added" state that lied, and deletes that silently matched nothing. A
 * fourth spelling on this screen would reintroduce all three — so the test
 * imports the real function and asserts the request carries *its* output, not a
 * string this file happens to agree with today.
 *
 * ── 409 is a success path wearing an error's clothes ────────────────────────
 *
 * The route returns 409 when the identifier already exists. That is the dedupe
 * working. Reporting it as a failure would tell somebody their add broke when
 * the item is sitting on the list in front of them.
 *
 * `userEvent` throughout, never `fireEvent` — see `AddVehicleScreen.test.tsx`.
 * `render` is awaited inside `mount` so no call site can forget it.
