/**
 * Scanning an invoice.
 *
 * The product's own pitch — point the phone at a receipt in the shop's car park
 * — and the flow with the most ways to strand somebody, because every step can
 * fail differently: the picker can be dismissed, the model can decide it is not
 * an invoice, it can read a *different car*, and the upload can fail in ways
 * that either will or will not survive a retry.
 *
 * ── Nothing native is mocked, by design ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `pickImage` is a **prop**. The screen never imports `expo-image-picker` —
 * `src/media/pick-image.ts` is the only module that does. So the picker
 * is injected here as a plain function, and these tests exercise the real
 * component with no native stubbing at all. That injection is why this screen
 * is testable and the camera path is not a black box.
 *
 * ── The two rules worth the whole file ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A retry is only offered when a retry could work.** A client-side rejection
 * — wrong type, too large — fails identically however many times the same file
 * is sent. Offering "Try again" there strands somebody on an error screen with
 * no way back to the picker, which is the 5 Aug dead end `retryable` exists to
 * fix.
 *
 * **A vehicle mismatch asks rather than files.** The model reading a different
 * car is the one failure that silently corrupts data if it guesses — an invoice
 * filed against the wrong vehicle is worse than one not filed at all.

  ── ⚠ LEG-02 · these tests are about scanning, not about consent ─────────────

  Guideline 5.1.2(i) (amended Nov 2025) requires explicit permission before
  personal data reaches a third-party AI, so the screen now asks before it opens
  the picker. Every case below assumes that question has already been answered —
  the consent flow itself is exercised in its own describe at the foot of this
  file.

  Mocked rather than written to `secureStorage`, because the store is
  `expo-secure-store` and there is none in a test runner.

  variable — the guard against a mock reading a value that has not initialised
  yet. The prefix is the documented escape hatch.
