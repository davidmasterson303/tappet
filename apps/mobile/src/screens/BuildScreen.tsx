/**
 * The build, on a screen of its own.
 *
 * ── What this replaces, and why moving it was the fix ───────────────────────
 *
 * A "Build" card on `VehicleDetailScreen`: a 104pt dial reading Stock, and
 * `<ProgressionLadder next={rungs[0].role} />` — the five-rung scale with a
 * marker on one of them. David's note on 23 Aug was exact:
 *
 *   *"the 'build' component has absolutely no utility, I don't know what it's
 *   there for. You can't tap in for details, you can't view a list and add
 *   things to a wishlist, you can't reject/decline from the plan. It's big and
 *   confusing right now."*
 *
 * ⚠ **Every one of those was already computed and thrown away.** `nextRungs`
 * returns `{ name, purpose, difficulty, role, rationale }` for each suggestion
 * — the part, what it does, how hard it is, and the sentence explaining why it
 * comes before the others. The card read `rungs[0].role` and discarded the rest,
 * so a screen carrying three named recommendations rendered the word
 * "Foundation" and nothing else. It was not a component missing a feature; it
 * was a component showing 1/5th of what it had been handed.
 *
 * The design system says the same thing from the other side —
 * `specs/progression-ladder.spec.html` draws exactly these rows, with the role,
 * the difficulty and the sentence: *"a ladder, not a catalogue"*.
 *
 * ── Why a route rather than a bigger card ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * David's call, and it is the right one: three suggestions each needing a name,
 * two chips, a sentence of reasoning and two controls do not fit under a dial
 * on a screen whose job is to summarise a car. The vehicle screen keeps one row
 * naming the zone; everything that can be *done* about a build lives here.
 *
 * ── Cold start is the normal case ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `modification_tracking` is empty across the entire product — re-confirmed
 * against the live database on 23 Aug. So `completed` is `[]`, every car reads
 * Stock, and the dial sits at rest. That is the honest state, and the ladder is
 * built for it: with no history the first step genuinely is the first step.
 *
 * ⚠ A resting dial is **not** a bad reading, and nothing here may colour it as
 * one. `build-progress.ts` owns a separate ramp from the health band for
 * exactly this reason — a stock car is not a failing car.
