/**
 * Phase 5.6 — the wishlist, on the phone.
 *
 * ── This widens the mobile surface, and that was a decision ─────────────────
 *
 * `cc-product-0001` says mobile is three flows — scan an invoice, ask the
 * advisor, glance at garage health — and that new features default to
 * `mobile: n/a`, with any widening argued explicitly and agreed by David. He
 * agreed on 7 Aug 2026: "people may want to add items to wishlist on the go."
 *
 * That entry's own open question, written 25 July, called this exact moment:
 * *"Push notifications land in the garage flow; whether that widens the surface
 * in practice is worth watching."* It does, and this is it. The KB entry needs
 * revising rather than quietly contradicting.
 *
 * ── Against the existing route, which had to be fixed first ─────────────────
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/wishlist` authenticated cookie-only until `922576f`, so this
 * screen could have added and deleted items and never listed them. The bug was
 * invisible from the web app and would have looked like an empty wishlist here.
 *
 * ── ⚠ 23 Aug: the free-text defence had expired ────────────────────────────
 *
 * This docblock used to say: *"The web adds items from three places — the
 * dossier, the consultant, and a manual dialog — because it has the surfaces
 * that suggest them. The phone has none of those yet, so a free-text add is the
 * honest version."*
 *
 * The phone had them. `vehicle_knowledge_base` is on the `load-vehicle`
 * payload this screen sits one route from, `BuildScreen` had been reading
 * `common_mods` out of it since the same morning, and `known_issues` and
 * `maintenance_schedule` map onto the other two wishlist types exactly.
 *
 * David's verdict was *"totally underbaked"*, and the shape of the fix was his
 * too: suggestions with Add and Learn more, filterable as you type.
 * `WishlistAddScreen` is that catalogue; this screen is the list it feeds.
 *
 * ── What this screen is now ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The list, and only the list: a summary line, the rows, and the two things
 * you can do to a row. Adding moved off it entirely — the composer used to sit
 * above the first item and made this a data-entry form with a list underneath.
 *
 * The identifier still comes from `@wellkept/core/wishlist-identifier`, which
 * exists because three call sites once built it three different ways and
 * produced duplicates, a lying "already added" state, and deletes that silently
 * matched nothing. A fourth spelling anywhere reintroduces all three.

   *
   * Reported upward rather than decided in the navigator, because only this

    An explicit fill, **not `opacity`**, and that is a testability decision as
    much as a design one.

    `opacity` on the parent is the obvious way to grey a button out, and the
    contrast audit cannot see it: `auditText` derives each text's surface from
    the style tree, and a parent alpha never reaches the comparison. Verified —
    dropping the old `opacity: 0.55` to `0.12` left all 39 mobile tests green
    while making the label genuinely unreadable. A guard that cannot fail on
    the thing it is named after is worse than no guard.

    A real colour is measured. #8f8f8f against the near-black label reads about
    6.2:1, and taking it darker turns the suite red, which is the whole point.

   * The card, on the ladder rather than beside it.
   *
   * ⚠ This was a **private copy** — `surface.raised` with no border, where the
   * `Card` primitive is `surface.card` with `border.panel`. `raised` is the
   * ladder's step for bars, tab strips and chips; a card painted on it sits one
   * step off from every other card in the app, which is precisely the "twelve
   * slightly different containers" the primitive set was built to end.
   *
   * The gap is kept as it was. Padding and gaps across this app want a pass
   * with a designer's eye rather than a find-and-replace — see the note in
   * `mobile-radius-scale.test.ts` on why that rule was scoped to radius.
