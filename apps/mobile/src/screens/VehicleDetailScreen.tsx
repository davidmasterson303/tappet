/**
 * Phase 3.2, second half — the detail behind a garage row.
 *
 * The list has existed since 1 Aug and its rows were not tappable, so this is
 * the half of 3.2 that was never built rather than a new idea.
 *
 * ── One request, and no photograph ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /api/v1/load-vehicle?vehicleId=…` returns the vehicle, its knowledge
 * base, the computed health drivers and the score history in one round trip —
 * already stripped of `custom_image_url` and carrying a signed `photo_url`.
 *
 * ── The photograph, which this screen used to decline to draw ───────────────
 *
 * It did, and the reason was sound at the time: the signed URL points at the
 * stored original, the one real photo on this account is a 2.3 MB legacy upload
 * that never decodes on a device, and repeating the garage card's timeout
 * machinery here would have doubled a net rather than removed the need for one.
 *
 * All three parts of that changed on 15 Aug. The net is now **one component** —
 * `VehiclePlate` owns the timeout, the two exits from loading and the fallback,
 * so the hero reuses it rather than copying it. And the plate is no longer a
 * dead end: `/api/v1/upload-photo` means a car that falls back to it can be
 * given a picture from this screen.
 * `GarageScreen`'s `PHOTO_TIMEOUT_MS` docblock carries the full measurement.
 *
 * ── States, and which ones are not errors ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Loading, loaded, and the two that get skipped. **401** is not an error box:
 * `App.tsx` swaps to sign-in the moment the session clears, so this reports it
 * plainly and calls `onSignOut`. **404** is its own state and not a crash — a
 * vehicle deleted on the web while this screen sat open is an ordinary race,
 * and the honest answer is that it is gone, with a way back.
 *
 * ── Why the shared health band, again ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same reasoning as the garage: `@wellkept/core/health-band` holds the
 * thresholds and the wording, the web dashboard reads it, and a local copy of
 * "80 is good" drifts silently. This screen and the row it came from must
 * agree, and the only way to guarantee that is to not have a second opinion.

        ── z7 · THE SCORE, in the nav ──────────────────────────────────────────

        ⚠ **The hero dial is gone, and this is what replaced it.** David,
        23 Aug: *"we can lose the dial with health score overlaying car image.
        The animation is fun but info is redundant and it might cover an
        important part of the car image people care about."*

        Both halves are right, and the second is the one that settles it. The
        photograph is the only place in the product an owner sees their own car,
        and a 160pt plinth sat in the middle of it — over the roofline on most
        3:4 phone snapshots. An instrument that obscures the subject it is
        reporting on has its priorities inverted.

        The redundancy was real too, and self-inflicted: the health card gained
        its own reading earlier the same day, so by then the score appeared
        three times. Two remain, and they do different jobs — this is chrome
        that persists, and the card's is the subject of the paragraph under it.

        What went with it: `dialFlight`, the 1.6× climb, the crossfade, and the
        layering invariant that was the hardest part of the design. There is no
        travelling instrument left to collide with the sheet, so the rule that
        governed it has nothing to govern. That is a real simplification rather
        than a deletion — logged for Design in `docs/design-system-drift.md`.

            The chip was `pointerEvents="none"` chrome: an arc and the numeral
            70, which a screen reader announced as "Health score 70 out of 100 —
            Fair" and then offered nothing to do with. Meanwhile the only way
            into the health detail was a row most of the way down the sheet.

            It persists through the whole scroll, so it is the one affordance
            that is always in reach. The spoken name says where it goes, because
            a reading and a door to a reading are different things and the arc
            cannot distinguish them.

            ⚠ `hitSlop`, for the same reason as the back pill — the chip is
            drawn at the size that reads over a photograph, and the target is
            grown around it rather than the drawing being inflated.
