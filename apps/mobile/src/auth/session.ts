 * "Could not reach Well Kept" is emitted for *any* message matching
 * `network|fetch|timeout`, and the original never reaches anyone.
 *
 * That cost an hour on 13 Aug. A sign-in failed repeatedly on the simulator and
 * the mapped sentence was the only evidence available, so the endpoint, the
 * publishable key, the client version, the device's own reachability and the
 * account itself were each cleared individually — all of them fine — because
 * the one fact that would have named the cause was being discarded one line
 * before it was displayed.

 * along with the raw message. It must never become a user-facing surface:
 * relaying Supabase verbatim on sign-in is the account-existence oracle the

 *
 * ⚠ The `typeof` guard is load-bearing, not defensive habit. `__DEV__` is
 * defined by Metro and by jest-expo, and **not** by the web suite's `node`
 * environment — and `lib/__tests__/mobile-session.test.ts` requires this module
 * directly from there. A bare `!__DEV__` throws `ReferenceError` before any
 * assertion runs, which is how this arrived: eleven passing tests turned red in
 * a file that had nothing to do with the change.

 *
 * Supabase returns a session immediately when email confirmation is off, and
 * returns a user with **no session** when it is on. Both are successes and they
 * need different words on screen — "you're in" versus "check your email" — so
 * this reports which happened rather than guessing at the project's setting.
 * Guessing wrong strands someone on a screen that says nothing.

 *
 * The web app has had `/forgot-password` since before the pivot, and this app
 * had no route to it at all — verified 13 Aug: zero occurrences of "forgot" or
 * `resetPasswordForEmail` anywhere in `apps/mobile`. On a companion that was
 * survivable, because the browser was always the way in. On a mobile-first
 * product it means someone who mistypes their password at the App Store's front
 * door has no way back in without being told, somewhere else, to go and use a
 * website they have no reason to know exists.
 *
 * ── The link points at the web app on purpose ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Supabase sends a URL, and something has to render a "choose a new password"
 * form when it is opened. `app/reset-password/page.tsx` already does, is already
 * deployed, and already handles the recovery token. A native reset screen would
 * be a second implementation of a security-sensitive flow to save one hop out to
 * a browser, and the hop is where the emailed link naturally opens anyway.
 *
 * ⚠ `redirectTo` must be allow-listed in Supabase → Authentication → URL
 * Configuration → Redirect URLs, or the link in the email lands on an error
 * page. That is a dashboard setting and cannot be read from here.
 *
 * ── This deliberately reports success it has not verified ───────────────────
 *
 * Supabase returns the same result whether or not the address has an account,
 * and this passes that through unchanged. Reporting "no such account" would
 * make an unauthenticated screen answer "does this person use Well Kept" — the
 * account-existence oracle `signIn` is written to avoid, reachable by anyone who
 * downloads the app. So the copy says what was *sent*, never what was *found*.

/**
 * Send the confirmation email again.
 *
 * ── The trap this exists to stay ahead of ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `signIn` collapses every credential failure into one message, deliberately.
 * One of the messages it collapses is "Email not confirmed", which today cannot
 * occur: email confirmation is **off** on this Supabase project — checked in
 * the dashboard on 1 Aug, Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Confirm email,
 * disabled. Nobody can be in an unconfirmed state, so nobody is being told
 * their password is wrong with no way forward.
 *
 * That is one toggle away from being false, and it is a plausible toggle:
 * enabling confirmation is standard pre-launch hardening and App Store review
 * is exactly what prompts it. The moment it flips, a user who signed up and did
 * not confirm gets "that email and password did not match" and no path out.
 *
 * The dependency is a dashboard fact no file in this repo can observe, which is
 * why it is written down here rather than left to be rediscovered. Same class
 * as the SQL Editor modal.
 *
 * ── Why this is unconditional, and must stay unconditional ──────────────────
 *
 * The obvious fix is to detect the unconfirmed case and offer a resend button
 * for it. **That reintroduces the oracle the collapsed message exists to
 * close.** A button that appears only for registered-but-unconfirmed addresses
 * announces exactly which addresses those are — the leak simply moves from the
 * message text into the UI.
 *
 * So resending is always available, offered to everyone, and reports the same
 * outcome whatever the address. Its presence says nothing, and its result says
 * nothing. `signIn` deliberately returns no "needs confirmation" flag: a flag
 * would exist only to be rendered conditionally, which is the leak again.
 *
 * The caller shows one message regardless — "If that address needs confirming,
 * we have sent a new link." True for a registered address, true for an
 * unregistered one, and useful to the only person who legitimately cares.
