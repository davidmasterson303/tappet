/**
 * Telling the server where to send this device's notifications.
 *
 * Phase 5's remaining client work. Permission, delivery and tap-routing shipped
 * on 5 Aug; none of it could ever fire, because the server had no address to
 * send to.
 *
 * ── The device id is generated here, not read off the hardware ──────────────
 *
 * `expo-device` exposes real identifiers and is **not installed** — adding it
 * would spend one of fifteen monthly cloud builds for something this does not
 * need. A random id minted once and kept in the Keychain is stable for the
 * life of an install, which is exactly the lifetime a push token has.
 *
 * It is also the better answer on privacy, not merely the cheaper one. A
 * hardware identifier is stable across *uninstalls* and correlates a person
 * across apps; this one dies with the app and correlates nothing. The table
 * storing it says the same: no device name, no model, no OS version.
 *
 * `Math.random` is fine for it. This is an opaque local label whose only
 * requirement is not colliding with the same account's other handset — it is
 * not a secret, it authenticates nothing, and treating it as though it did
 * would imply a guarantee it does not carry.
 *
 * ── Why registration is best-effort ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Push is an enhancement. A signed-in person with a working garage must not
 * see an error because a notification address could not be filed, so every
 * failure here is logged and swallowed. The one thing that would be worse than
 * no notifications is an app that will not open without them.
