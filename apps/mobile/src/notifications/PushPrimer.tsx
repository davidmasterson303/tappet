/**
 * The screen that comes *before* iOS asks. Phase 5, C5.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * iOS shows its notification dialog exactly once and a "no" is only undoable in
 * Settings. Until this screen, the app spent that one ask on entry to the
 * signed-in stack — on somebody who had just signed in and not yet seen what
 * the product does.
 *
 * This screen is refusable at no cost: declining it leaves the system ask
 * unspent, so it can be offered again in a month. That is the whole point.
 * **It is not a second prompt bolted onto the first; it is what makes the first
 * one recoverable.**
 *
 * ── The copy is not mine ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every string comes from `PUSH_PRIMER_COPY` in `@wellkept/core/push-priming`,
 * marked as a placeholder for David in Phase 5.5. Nothing is written inline
 * here, so replacing the wording is one edit in one file, needs no build, and
 * cannot leave this component saying something the shared copy does not.
 *
 * ── Decline is not a lesser button ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Not now" is a full-width control with the same tap target as accept, not
 * greyed text in a corner. A primer that makes refusal awkward gets a resentful
 * yes or a system-level no, and the second one is permanent — so the design
 * that looks weaker converts better where it counts.

            The primitive, not a private pair.

            These were two hand-rolled `Pressable`s that reimplemented `primary`
            and `outline` — and reimplemented them differently. Their pressed
            state was `opacity: 0.9`, which fades the **label** along with the
            fill; `Button`'s rule is that pressed deepens and never lightens, so
            the ink keeps its full strength. They also carried the card radius
            on a button, and their own 52pt height where the primitive already
            holds the 44pt floor.

            One control, one set of states, one place to fix them.
