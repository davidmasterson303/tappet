/**
 * The health score as an instrument cluster, on the phone.
 *
 * The web `ClusterGauge` argues the design at length and that argument is not
 * repeated here: a 270° tachometer face open at the bottom, ticks with the
 * numbers on the majors, one accent used as light rather than fill, and a
 * needle sweep at ignition. Read `components/ClusterGauge.tsx` for the why.
 *
 * What this file is responsible for is the three ways the phone is not a
 * browser.
 *
 * ── 1. The geometry is imported, not re-typed ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `@wellkept/core/cluster-geometry` already exists for exactly this reason —
 * `BuildGauge` needed the same dial and a second copy of
 * `M 50.5 149.5 A 70 70 0 1 1 149.5 149.5` is a second copy. A third client
 * hand-copying it is the same mistake at worse odds, because the drift would be
 * invisible until someone held a phone next to a laptop.
 *
 * ── 2. `pathLength` does not exist on this renderer ─────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ The web dial normalises the arc with `pathLength={100}` so the dasharray is
 * literally the score — no circumference arithmetic and no chance of the fill
 * and the track describing different curves. **`react-native-svg` does not
 * implement `pathLength` on native.** It appears once in that package, in
 * `src/web/utils`, the react-native-web passthrough list — so on a device the
 * attribute is dropped silently and a dasharray of `61 100` paints 61 *user
 * units* of a 330-unit arc: every reading would land at about a fifth of its
 * true position, and it would look plausible.
 *
 * So the length is computed here, once, from the geometry the arc is actually
 * drawn with. `cluster-gauge.test.tsx` pins it against R.
 *
 * ── 3. Under `DIAL_MIN` this stops drawing a dial ───────────────────────────
 *
 * At row scale the ticks do not resolve and an instrument that cannot be read
 * is decoration. The `row` variant is not a smaller dial, it is a different
 * object: a tabular numeral and the verdict, both in the band colour.
 */

/**
 * The lit arc's length in user units — 270° at r=70.

    ── The readout is real text on top of the SVG, not `<SvgText>` ────────────

    ⚠ `react-native-svg`'s `fontVariant` is the **SVG** property — `normal` or
    `small-caps`. It has no tabular-numerals setting of any kind, so a number
    drawn inside the SVG gets proportional figures.

    That is fine for the tick numbers, which never change. It is not fine for
    the readout: the sweep animates it through every value from 0 to 100 and
    back down, and with proportional figures a 1 is about half the width of a 7
    — the number visibly jitters sideways for the whole 900ms. `TABULAR` exists
    in the theme for exactly this and only React Native's own `Text` honours it.

    So the readout is positioned over the dial instead. The arithmetic is the
    viewBox mapping, stated once: the hero's readout line is y=150 of a 200-wide
    box drawn at `width`, and the card's number sits on the pivot, which its
