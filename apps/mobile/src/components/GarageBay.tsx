 * The board's own line: *"Home. One car in a lit room, swiped between. Door
 * lifts, bay lights come up, needle sweeps."* A list of cards is a database
 * browser; a bay is a place you keep a car. The difference is the whole reason
 * the hero dial exists — a 184pt instrument has nowhere to live in a list row,
 * which is why this and the plinth were deferred out of step 3 rather than
 * built around a placeholder and then built again.
 *
 * ── The size the board actually uses ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ **164, not `HERO_SIZE`.** The instruments card specifies the hero at 184pt;
 * the bay screen passes `size="164"`. Both are the board's, and the screen is
 * the more specific claim — 184 is the dial's own design size, 164 is what fits
 * a bay with a room, an identity lockup and a service row above the fold. The
 * component default is untouched; the caller chooses, which is exactly how the
 * board expresses it too.
