    React Native's `Pressable` drives its pressed state through `usePressability`

    synthetic `pressIn` on the host node leaves `style` resolved for
    `pressed: false`, so the tree only ever shows the resting state. Measured —
    both a `props.style` read and a `fireEvent(row, 'pressIn')` returned the
    resting value.

    So "a pressed style must change something" lives in
    `lib/__tests__/mobile-pressed-states.test.ts` as a source rule instead. That
    is a weaker kind of check and it is the kind available: the defect it exists
    for — `ListRow`'s `pressed: { opacity: 1 }`, a declaration that changes
