/**
 * What the health score is made of — the three drivers.
 *
 * ── ⚠ These do not add up to the score, and this component must not imply it ─
 *
 * `health_score` comes from the model. These three are **computed** from facts
 * the database holds — `evaluateSchedule` over the car's own schedule, the
 * NHTSA recall list, and mileage against model-year age. So they explain the
 * *subject* without arithmetically explaining the *total*.
 *
 * That is why they are laid out as three peers with their own labels, and never
 * as terms in a sum. No plus signs, no "= 74", no ordering that suggests one
 * contributes more than another. `health-drivers.ts` carries the same warning
 * at the source; this is where it would actually be broken.
 *
 * Whether `health_score` eventually becomes a function of the three is a
 * product decision that has not been taken.
 *
 * ── Why each driver carries a sentence ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the card exists to be tapped. A number with no account of itself is
 * the black box this product's whole argument is against — and it is the reason
 * the drivers are computed rather than generated, since a driver the model
 * invented could not be explained at all.
