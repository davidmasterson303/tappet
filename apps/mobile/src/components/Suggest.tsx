/**
 * A text field that offers what it knows, and still takes what it does not.
 *
 * ── Why this is a field with a list under it, and not a picker ──────────────
 *
 * A picker asserts that the list is complete. This product's lists are not:
 * `COMMON_MAKES` is 56 marques an owner in this market is likely to pick, and
 * vPIC's model list is whatever NHTSA has registered for one make in one year,
 * which is missing plenty of grey imports and every kit car. A control that
 * cannot express "mine is not in here" would refuse those cars outright, which
 * is `CLAUDE.md` §10 broken in the most literal way available — asserting a
 * precision the data does not have.
 *
 * So the input is always a real text input, the suggestions are an accelerator,
 * and nothing here can block a submit. The list going missing — offline, vPIC
 * down, a make nobody has registered — degrades this to exactly the field that
 * shipped before it.
 *
 * ── Inline, not floating ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The suggestions push the form down rather than overlaying it. An absolutely
 * positioned dropdown inside a `ScrollView` is clipped by the scroller on
 * Android and mis-measures on iOS the moment the keyboard resizes the frame,
 * and the failure is invisible in a simulator held at one size. Pushing costs a
 * little movement and works everywhere.
 *
 * ⚠ The scroller above this **must** carry `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`
 * or the first tap on a suggestion is swallowed dismissing the keyboard, and
 * the owner has to tap every choice twice. `AddVehicleScreen` sets it; it is
 * noted here because this component cannot.
 *
 * ── Which panel is open is the form's business, not this component's ────────
 *
 * `open` is a prop rather than internal focus state, and the reason is a bug
 * that only appears with more than one of these on a screen. Nothing here
 * closes on blur — see the ⚠ at `onFocus` for why it must not — so a component
 * owning its own open flag would leave every panel it had ever opened on
 * screen at once, each shoving the form further down as the owner tabs through
 * it.
 *
 * One `openField` in the parent makes focusing the model close the make, which
 * is the behaviour anyone would expect and cannot be built from local state.
