/**
 * The five rungs, and where this car is on them.
 *
 * ── What it is for ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `nextRungs` answers "what should I do next"; it does not answer "why that,
 * and not the turbo". The ladder is the second question drawn: **foundation,
 * then control, then the parts that enable the next step, then the parts that
 * keep it alive, then appearance.** An owner who can see the sequence can
 * disagree with it, which is the point — a recommendation with no visible
 * reasoning is a black box, and this product's whole argument is that it is not
 * one.
 *
 * ── Cold start is the normal case, not the empty state ──────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ `modification_tracking` is **empty across the entire product** — nobody has
 * recorded a completed mod. So the overwhelmingly common render is *nothing
 * done, foundation next*, and that is not a failure to design around with an
 * `EmptyState`: with no history, the first step genuinely is the first step.
 * The ladder shows the whole scale from the first launch and marks where the
 * car actually is. `mod-progression.ts` makes the same argument in its header.
 *
 * ── Why the wording is imported ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `roleLabel` lives in core for the reason `progressionSummary` does: a rung the
 * phone calls "Handling" and the web calls "Control" is two ladders. In
 * particular `control` reads "Control before more power", because the rung's
 * argument is *when* it comes rather than what it contains, and that argument is
 * product judgement rather than copy for this screen to choose.

              ── R45 · the state is a chip beside the rung, not under it ─────

              `done` and `next` were a **second line of muted text under the
              rung's name**, which reads as a subtitle that has been truncated
              to one word — the review's phrasing was "a broken subtitle", and
              that is exactly what it looked like. A state is not a description
              of the thing; it is a mark on it.

              So they sit on the rung's own line, right-aligned. The row's name
              takes the slack and the state keeps its width.

              One state word, never both. A rung cannot be finished and next at
              the same time, and rendering two where one is possible is how a
              "done · next" appears in a screenshot nobody can explain.

              ⚠ These stay **words**, not colour alone. A marker that only
              changed hue would carry the entire state on a 10pt dot, which
              fails for anyone who cannot separate the two.
