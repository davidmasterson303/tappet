/**
 * How far this build has come, on the cluster dial — on the phone.
 *
 * ── Why this is a sibling of `ClusterGauge` and not a variant of it ─────────
 *
 * The same argument the web pair makes, and it survives the port unchanged.
 * The health gauge is hardwired to health semantics, correctly: it bands the
 * score, announces "Health score 61 out of 100 — Fair", and paints low readings
 * red. **On a build dial a low reading is not bad, it is stock.** Reusing the
 * health gauge would render an unmodified car as a critical failure and
 * announce it to a screen reader as one.
 *
 * So the geometry is shared through `@wellkept/core/cluster-geometry`, the
 * region is shared through `@wellkept/core/build-progress`, and the *meaning*
 * is not shared with health at all. Two gauges in one cluster, one set of
 * numbers describing the glass.
 *
 * ── The needle never reaches the end, and that is the argument ──────────────
 *
 * `buildPosition` maps accumulated effort through an asymptote, so no amount of
 * work pegs the dial. A progress bar that fills says "you are finished"; this
 * says "there is always something more you can do", which is the thing David
 * asked the product to express. It is made in glass rather than in copy.
 *
 * ── Two things the phone changes ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **`pathLength` is not implemented by `react-native-svg` on native**, so the
 * arc length is computed rather than normalised — the note in `ClusterGauge`
 * has the detail, and both files take the length from the same expression.
 *
 * **The web dial animates with a CSS transition**, which fires on a change and
 * not on mount. `Animated` has no such distinction, so the mount case is
 * excluded explicitly below: the build dial is still when it appears and moves
 * only when the car does.

        word again directly beneath it — `Stock` over `Stock`, which reads as a
        label above a value where the label has been filled in with the value.

        structure, which this dial already shares the geometry of — and it is
        what makes the needle's position mean something to somebody looking at
        it.

        something, which is exactly the end state this dial exists to avoid. It
