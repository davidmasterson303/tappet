/**
 * The identity plate — the phone's version of CC-142.
 *
 * ── What this replaces, and why it was wrong ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The garage card rendered a grey box containing the words **"No photo"**.
 * That is a placeholder, not a design: it names an absence, so a garage of
 * unphotographed cars reads as a garage of incomplete records.
 *
 * Web settled this and mobile never got it. v7 had shrunk the photo to a strip
 * that appeared *only* when a photograph existed, reasoning that "a card that
 * is complete without a photo is better than a card that is never allowed to
 * lack one" — sound, and premised on the no-photo state looking broken. CC-142
 * removed the premise: the no-photo state became **a deterministic make-derived
 * field with the vehicle named on it**, which is a finished design rather than
 * an absence, and so earns the space v7 correctly denied it.
 *
 * ⚠ The two halves only make sense together. A plate without the lockup
 * reinstates exactly the bug v7 was avoiding.
 *
 * ── Why the colour comes from core ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `vehicleFieldStops` is `vehicleField` in a notation React Native can read —
 * same hash, same three axes, converted out of `oklch()` because RN's colour
 * grammar has no such function and its StyleSheet has no gradient at all. A
 * BMW is the same blue on both clients or it is two designs.
 *
 * ── The field is painted under a photograph too ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not only as a fallback. It is what shows for the instant before a photo
 * decodes, so the card never flashes an empty rectangle on its way to an
 * image — the same reason the web plate paints unconditionally.
 */

/**
 * How long a photo may stay unresolved before the plate gives up on it.
 *
 * ── Two exits from "loading", not one ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A React Native `Image` pointed at a URL that never responds stays loading
 * indefinitely. It draws nothing and `onError` never fires, because nothing has
 * failed — so a fallback gated on failure is unreachable and the card shows a
 * blank rectangle the colour of itself, forever.
 *
 * Measured on the simulator, 1 Aug: inside one render, a `fetch` of the API
 * host returned 200 while a `fetch` of this vehicle's signed storage URL did
 * not resolve within eight seconds. Same app, same network, same moment. The
 * request hangs; it does not fail.
 *
 * A phone on a weak connection produces the identical shape, which makes it a
 * product state rather than an environment quirk. So loading exits on an error
 * *or* on running out of patience, and both land on the lockup: a picture that
 * has not arrived and a picture that does not exist look the same to the person
 * holding the phone, and both mean the car has to name itself.
 *
 * ── The measurement history, moved here with the behaviour ─────────────────
 *
 * Measured 1 Aug, in this order, because the first three readings were wrong:
 *
 *   - `fetch` of the URL from inside the app did not resolve in 8s, while a
 *     control fetch to the API host returned 200. **That comparison was
 *     invalid** — React Native's `fetch` runs on XMLHttpRequest and buffers the
 *     whole body, so it measured 2.3 MB against a few hundred bytes of JSON,
 *     not reachability.
 *   - Cowork fetched the same signed URL from the host: 200, image/jpeg, all
 *     2.3 MB in 1.23s. The object and the URL are fine.
 *   - 90s timeout: still nothing. So it is not slow, it is stuck.
 *   - A tiny inline PNG beside it rendered immediately. So `Image` is fine and
 *     this file specifically is not decodable here.
 *
 * **The fix this comment used to recommend does not exist.** It said to sign a
 * *transformed* URL sized for a list. `47af5c4` tried that the next day and
 * Supabase image transformation returns `FeatureNotEnabled` for this tenant —
 * verified against the live API, not inferred from a pricing page. The server
 * cannot re-encode either: `sharp` is a devDependency whose outputs are
 * committed precisely because Netlify never runs it.
 *
 * What is actually true now:
 *
 *   - **This object is legacy.** 2,328,761 bytes, uploaded 2026-07-28 00:42
 *     UTC, sixteen hours before `eb320f9` wired the browser downscale. It is
 *     the one file the client-side fix could never have caught.
 *   - **New uploads cannot repeat it.** `47af5c4` put a 1.5 MB ceiling at
 *     `uploadVehiclePhoto`, the one chokepoint every upload passes, against a
 *     150 KB target — so a file arriving above it means the downscale did not
 *     run, which is the case worth refusing rather than storing forever.
 *   - **The remaining instance is fixable by hand in about thirty seconds**:
 *     re-upload the M235i photo in the web app and it downscales on the way in.
 *
 * So this timeout stays, because a phone on a weak connection produces the same
 * shape as an undecodable file and both have to land somewhere. A genuinely
 * card-sized image still needs either the paid transform feature or a
 * derivative generated at upload — both decisions with a cost, neither taken.
