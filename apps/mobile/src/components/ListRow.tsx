 * One row in a divider-separated list.
 *
 * ── Divider-separated, never striped ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Alternating fills read as a table of records; a hairline between rows reads
 * as a list of things. This product's rows are things — a service, a recall, a
 * mileage reading — and the summary cards on the garage and vehicle screens are
 * built from them.
 *
 * ── The value is tabular, always ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mileage, dates, prices and scores must not reflow as their digits change. A
 * number that shifts sideways while it updates reads as a glitch, and on a list
 * of them the whole column shimmers.
 *
 * ── A missing value is an em dash, never a vanished row ─────────────────────
 *
 * If the row exists, the label is a promise that this fact is tracked. Dropping
 * the row when the value is unknown silently rewrites what the product claims
 * to know — and it is the difference between "we have no reading" and "we do
 * not track this".
