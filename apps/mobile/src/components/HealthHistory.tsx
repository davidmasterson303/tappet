/**
 * The score over time — the fourth instrument.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The web chart's ramp is not the product's ramp ────────────────────────
 *
 * `components/HealthHistoryChart.tsx` picks its line colour from four hexes
 * written into the component: `#4ade80`, `#22d3ee`, `#fb923c`, `#f87171` at 80
 * / 60 / 40. The thresholds happen to match `@wellkept/core/health-band`; **the
 * colours do not.** The band's own are `127,206,156`, `185,199,126`,
 * `224,164,104`, `224,136,130`.
 *
 * So a web user reading 71 sees a cyan trend line beside a `ClusterGauge` in
 * the band's muted teal, and the two instruments disagree about what "Fair"
 * looks like on one screen. That is precisely the failure `health-band.ts` was
 * extracted to end, and it survived because the chart predates the extraction.
 *
 * **This file bands from core.** Porting the literals would have copied a
 * defect onto a second client and made it twice as expensive to fix. The web
 * chart is left alone — it is shipped, it is not part of step 4, and changing a
 * live component while building a new one is how both break. It is written up
 * for David rather than fixed quietly.
 *
 * ── Why it measures rather than scales ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A sparkline in a viewBox either letterboxes or distorts, and a distorted one
 * turns the dots into ellipses and the stroke into two different widths. So the
 * width is measured with `onLayout` and the geometry is computed in real points.
 * One render pass costs nothing here — the chart is inside a card that has
 * already laid out.

 * reason for the phone to hold a different opinion about what "moved" means.
