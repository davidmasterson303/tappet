/**
 * The lit room a car stands in.
 *
 * ── Why this is not `VehiclePlate` at another size ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The plate is a **card treatment**: a make-derived field with the vehicle named
 * on it, so a garage of unphotographed cars still reads as a set of distinct
 * objects. The bay is a **place**. One car, lit from above, and the light is
 * the same light for every car in the garage — a room whose colour changed per
 * make would read as a lightbox, not a garage.
 *
 * So they share no paint. `vehicleFieldStops` is deliberately absent here.
 *
 * ── The lighting stack, from the baseline board ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `radial-gradient(130% 110% at 50% 16%, #2a2724, #111214 74%)` — the source is
 * up near the ceiling and slightly forward, which is where a garage strip light
 * actually is, and the fall-off reaches the far corners rather than vignetting
 * hard. Rendered as SVG because React Native's StyleSheet has no gradient.
 *
 * ⚠ The gradient is wider than it is tall in *percentage* terms (130% × 110%),
 * which an SVG radial cannot say directly — it takes one radius. The ellipse
 * ratio is restored with `gradientTransform`, because scaling the whole `<Rect>`
 * instead would scale the wordmark sitting on it.
 *
 * ── 23 Aug: the room became a hero, and why every part of that changed ──────
 *
 * It was a 112pt inset panel with the photograph **contained** inside it. On a
 * 393pt screen that gave a landscape photo roughly 149 × 112 of actual car,
 * centred in a box with dead gradient either side — a thumbnail on the one
 * screen whose entire argument is *"one car in a lit room"*. Manual testing
 * called it exactly what it was.
 *
 * Three changes, and they only work together:
 *
 *   - **Full bleed.** No border, no corner radius, no page inset. The room is
 *     now the width of the phone, and the bay's other rows carry the inset that
 *     used to live on the whole stack.
 *   - **contain-over-blur**, lifted from web's `VehicleIdentity` rather than
 *     invented here. A sharp *contained* copy over an over-scanned *blurred*
 *     copy of itself. This is the part that makes the extra size safe: filling
 *     a wide box by cropping `cover` is what web removed in CC-142, because on
 *     a 3:4 phone photo — the overwhelmingly common upload — a centre crop
 *     enlarges ~3× and keeps a horizontal band through the vertical middle,
 *     which is sky, ceiling or strip lights. The car was frequently not in the
 *     hero at all. Contained over its own blur, a DSLR landscape and a vertical
 *     phone snapshot both land whole.
 *   - **A fade into the page**, so the identity lockup underneath has somewhere
 *     to sit. See `HERO_FADE` for why this is a fade to an opaque colour rather
 *     than a scrim over the photograph.
 *
 * `Image`'s `blurRadius` is a core React Native prop on both platforms, so the
 * blurred layer costs no native module and therefore no EAS build.

/**
 * The framed room's height, kept as the floor of the hero range.

 * Exported because the bay's door travels exactly the hero's height. A shutter

 * which is why this number and the door's are the same number.

 * that must not fall below the fold. A fixed 240 fits an iPhone 15 with room to
 * spare and pushes the dial off the bottom of an SE.
 *
 * 0.28 lands exactly on `BAY_HERO_MAX` at 852pt (the 15/16 Pro), which is the

 * hero it replaced composited a photograph through six layers and passed ~1.7%
 * of it at the bottom edge. The rule that came out of that is *nothing is
 * printed over a photograph* — so the fade reaches `surface.page` at full
 * opacity, the lockup sits below where it has landed, and the ink is measured
 * against the page exactly as the contrast harness assumes.
 *
 * A translucent scrim would be the version that fails: its real contrast would
 * depend on whatever the owner happened to photograph, which is unmeasurable
