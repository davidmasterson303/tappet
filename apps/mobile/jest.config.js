/**
 * The mobile test runner. Separate from the web's, deliberately.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it took until 5 August ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The Phase 3 plan lists it as a day-one ratchet — *"screens render against
 * recorded API fixtures, so a screen test cannot pass by hitting a live server
 * that happens to be up"* — and it was never built. The consequence was
 * measured rather than guessed: on 5 Aug, **nine defects were found by a person
 * tapping a screen and none by the 1,607-test suite.** At least three of them
 * were plain render bugs that this catches in milliseconds — an account button
 * that vanished in the error state, a Health card that could never appear, and
 * an answer that displayed its own markdown.
 *
 * Every mobile suite written before this is a **static source scan** living in
 * the web runner, because that is all the web runner can do with React Native:
 * `jest.config.js` at the root ignores `apps/` and says why — jsdom, the
 * next/jest transform, React 18 types. Those scans are real and have caught
 * real things, but not one of them can see a rendered pixel.
 *
 * ── Why the source scans stay where they are ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They run on every `npm test` from the repo root, which is what CI and habit
 * both reach for. Moving them here would make them conditional on someone
 * remembering a second command. This runner *adds* the capability that was
 * missing; it does not relocate the one that works.
