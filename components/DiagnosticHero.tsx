 *
 * The previous hero composited the photograph through six layers: a 42% warm
 * brown `.ph-tint`, `saturate(.62)`, a vignette, a double scrim from both
 * edges, and a duplicate 0×0 `<img>` — over a page background that was *the
 * same photograph again* at 18%. Measured passthrough at the bottom of the
 * hero was ~1.7%. Only about 75px of a 338px element was unobstructed, and
 * roughly a tenth of each 700 KB photograph did any visual work.
 *
 * The photographs were never the problem. The compositing was.
 *
 * ── Nothing is printed over the photograph any more ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The score and the vehicle's name used to sit *on* the image, which is what
 * made the scrims necessary in the first place — text over an unpredictable
 * photograph needs something to sit on. Moving the content beneath the band
 * removes the requirement rather than tuning it, and the band gets to be a
 * photograph instead of a textured backdrop.
 *
 * ── The crop anchor is gone with the crop ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `focalX` / `focalY` are no longer props. `VehicleIdentity` contains the
 * photo over a blurred copy of itself rather than cropping it, so there is no
 * crop to anchor. The columns still exist and are still edited in
 * VehiclePhotoUploadDialog; nothing on this screen reads them.

    It set `scanDone`, which drove three things: a cyan scan line across the
    photograph, the caption's flip from "Scanning…" to "Diagnostics complete",
    and `ClusterGauge`'s `active` prop. None of them was waiting on work —
    the score, the recalls and the records all arrive with the page — so the
    animation measured nothing but itself and the caption asserted a diagnostic
    that had not happened. `work-narration.ts` carries the full argument.

    ── ⚠ The beat stays, and counts something true ───────────────────────────

    `CODE_HANDOFF_2026-08-24.md` §1.4 is explicit, and it corrects an earlier
    reading of this decision that removed the count entirely: *"not to remove
    the beat but to make it narrate something real — count up the records
    actually read… Same reassurance, no fiction."*

    That is the better call. The moment of assembly was never the dishonest
    part — an instant answer does feel unearned, and deleting the moment throws
    away real reassurance to fix a problem the moment did not cause. What was
    wrong was the *subject*: a timer counting itself.

    So the sweep runs over `readWorkCount` — the real number of records on file.
    A car with twelve invoices counts to twelve because there are twelve, and a
    car with none has nothing to count and shows no caption at all.

    ⚠ The sentence's shape comes from `work`, not from `counted`. Only the
    numeral is substituted, so the caption never passes through the "no records"
    phrasing on its way up. `work-narration.ts` carries why that matters.

    lookup and no assessment.

    It names the records the assessment was built from instead. Every figure in
    it is a row somebody can go and count in the service log, which is the

    and not lost: the empty band says "No photograph yet" in its own centre, so

    A photograph is the content: it gets the full width, with the reading in a

    the image any more.

    An empty plate is not content. Given the same full width it was a 1130×170
    letterbox saying "No photograph yet", and the strip below it was a gauge
    with 600px of nothing to its right — two half-empty rows stacked. Side by
    side they make one composed row instead, and the plate stays big enough to
    read as the place a photograph goes.

                  It was — as `reason`, the same string `HealthSummary` prints
                  in "What's driving the score" directly below, verbatim, in
                  one screen.

                  The duplicate resolves *there* rather than here, and the
                  reason is the disclosure rather than the composition. That
                  paragraph is written by a model, and it has to be read with
                  the line that says so; `advice-disclosure.ts`: "a surface
                  that shows generated advice shows this". Beside the gauge it
                  would sit about 500px from that line on a phone.

                  So the hero carries what the *system* can vouch for — the
                  reading, and the records it was made from — and hands off.

                It sat above the gauge in `label-uppercase` — 12px mono
                small-caps reading "READ 11 SERVICE RECORDS." — and a design
                critique of the rendered page called it what it looked like: a
                debug string. Uppercase mono is this design system's voice for
                *labels*, and this is not a label; it is a sentence, already
                punctuated as one by `describeReadWork`.

                Set as a sentence and placed under the claim it qualifies, it
                does the job it was written for: the reading, then what the
                reading was made from. Handoff §1.4's requirement is unchanged
                — it renders only when there is something true to say, and
                `describeReadWork` still answers `null` when neither read
                resolved.

                ── ⚠ An underlined neutral, and the reasoning moved twice ─────

                This was `info` blue, then cyan, and is now neither. The first
                move was right about the problem — two blues both meaning
                "interactive" — and wrong about the fix.

                ⚠ **Cyan is the mark, not an accent.** `#22D3EE` is
                `BRAND_COLOR.glow` in Design's package: the plate's backlight,
                asserted against their own SVGs by `brand.test.ts`. Spending it
                on ordinary link text put the brand's light on every
                "see more" on the page, and three consecutive critiques read
                the result as a product with two competing signature colours —
                the score's olive and a "default dark-dashboard teal".

                So cyan goes back to being light: the mark, the batten, the
                focus ring, the primary fill. Links are an underlined neutral,
                which is what an editorial page uses and which cannot be
                mistaken for a semantic state.

                ⚠ This is a demotion, not a removal. Nothing in the brand
                package changes and nothing about the mark moves.
