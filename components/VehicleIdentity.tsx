/**
 * What a vehicle looks like — one component, two variants.
 *
 * ── The inversion this component exists to make ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The no-photo state is the **primary** design, not the fallback. The photo
 * variant is the same box with a photograph swapped in behind the field: same
 * height, same type positions, same everything. A photograph can therefore
 * never break the layout, because the layout already worked without one.
 *
 * That is the whole reason `/vehicles/default/hero-3x2.jpg` and
 * `/vehicles/placeholder.jpg` could both 404 unnoticed — with three seeded
 * vehicles all carrying hand-placed files, no code path ever rendered the
 * absent case. The first real user vehicle would have found it.
 *
 * ── contain-over-blur, and why it is load-bearing ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The sharp copy is **contained**, never cropped, over a blurred copy of
 * itself that fills the width. A landscape DSLR frame and a vertical phone
 * snapshot both land whole and centred.
 *
 * This is what makes unpredictable user uploads safe, and it removes every
 * aspect-ratio breakpoint from the layout. The previous hero cropped `cover`
 * anchored at centre, which on a 3:4 phone photo of a car — the overwhelmingly
 * common case — enlarged it ~3x and kept a horizontal band through the
 * vertical middle: sky, ceiling, or garage lights. The car was frequently not
 * in the hero at all.
 *
 * ── Nothing is printed over a photograph ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No tint, no scrim, no vignette. The previous hero composited through six
 * layers and measured ~1.7% passthrough at the bottom edge; roughly a tenth of
 * each 700 KB photograph did any visual work.
 *
 * The consequence for this component: when a photo renders, the type and the
 * glyph do **not**. They belong to the field. Callers put a vehicle's name in
 * the layout around the band, not on top of it.

    ── ⚠ Cover when it is safe to, contain when it is not — B2, 5 Sep ────────

    The brief asks for a hero that covers its panel edge-to-edge, and the
    docblock at the top of this file explains why that was removed: a
    centre-anchored `cover` enlarged a 3:4 phone photo ~3x and kept a
    horizontal band through the vertical middle — "the car was frequently not
    in the hero at all". That finding is intact and this does not undo it.

    What it does is stop applying the portrait remedy to landscape photographs.
    The band is roughly 2.9:1. A 3:2 frame cropped to that loses height from
    top and bottom of a picture composed with the car across the middle, which
    is what every one of the demo plates is. A 3:4 frame cropped to the same
    band loses about three quarters of its height, which is the documented
    disaster.

    So the rule is the aspect itself: landscape enough to survive the crop gets
    `cover`, anything else keeps `contain` and the plate beside it. 1.4 is
    below 3:2 (1.5) and comfortably above square, so the common phone shapes —
    3:4 at 0.75 and 1:1 — stay contained.

            a 390px phone the plate plus the heading above it filled the entire

            Owner photographs arrive at whatever temperature they were taken at,
            and the seeded garage shows the problem plainly: a golden-hour amber
            Accord beside a cold industrial-dock WRX. Four separate design
            critiques of the rendered page named it every time — three colour
            temperatures on one shelf reads as a scrapbook, which is the
            opposite of an archive.

            A studio grades the set. This is that, as one filter: pull most of
            the colour out, cool what is left, and drop the brightness a touch so
            the plates sit *in* the near-black page rather than glowing off it.

            ⚠ Deliberately not a duotone. A hard two-tone map would make every
            car the same object and throw away the one thing a photograph is
            for — this is the owner's actual car. Desaturating to 55% keeps it
            recognisably theirs while ending the temperature clash.

            The blurred fill underneath already carries `saturate(.8)
            brightness(.52)`; this is the same idea applied to the layer people
            actually look at.

                The probe is what actually issues the request — the two CSS
                layers ride its cache entry — so this is where priority has to
                be set. On the band variant that request is the page's LCP, and
                a zero-area `aria-hidden` image is exactly what a browser's
                heuristics deprioritise.

                Spelled lowercase and cast: React 18.2 has no `fetchPriority`
                prop, and passes unrecognised lowercase attributes straight
                through. React 19 adds the camelCase one — change it then, not
                before, or it silently stops being emitted.

                **You will see a console warning in `next dev`, and it is
                expected.** React DOM logs *"Invalid DOM property
                `fetchpriority`. Did you mean `fetchPriority`?"* on the client.
                Do not act on it. Measured against react-dom 18.2 directly:

                  lowercase -> <img src="x.jpg" fetchpriority="high"/>   no warning
                  camelCase -> <img src="x.jpg" fetchPriority="high"/>   warns, and
                               that casing is not the attribute browsers read

                So the suggestion in the warning is the regression, not the fix,
                and it is silent — the hint simply stops applying while the
                console goes quiet. The warning is development-only; React
                strips it from production builds, so the live site logs nothing.

            This drew an oversized generic car outline bleeding off the corner
            — and a design critique of the rendered page called it exactly
            what it looked like: "a grey clip-art car silhouette", scanning as
            a broken image on the first card a visitor sees.

            The glyph is gone. What replaces it is the plate as a plate: the
            field, a hairline inset frame, and one line saying what is missing.
            An empty state that names itself is designed; a picture of a car
            standing in for a picture of a car is a placeholder.

            ⚠ The no-photo state is the **primary** design here, not a fallback
            — this component's header says so, and the demo garage keeps one car
            unphotographed on purpose so a visitor sees what their own will look
            like before they upload. That is the whole reason it has to be worth
            looking at.

            On a card it draws a plate: 12px in from a 4:3 box, it reads as an
            edge with a margin. Stretched across the band it was a 700px-wide
            hairline rectangle around nothing, and it was the third concentric
            rounded rectangle in a row — hero section, then this, then the
            band's own radius — all within 40px and all nearly the same value.

            It printed `model` in 36px serif with `{year} {make} · {trim}` under
            it, and both are already on the screen: the page heading above the
            hero is the same three facts. On a phone the two renderings sat
            about 1100px apart, which is worse than adjacent — it reads as a
            second car rather than a repeat.

            This component's own docblock draws the line — *"Callers put a
            vehicle's name in the layout around the band, not on top of it"* —
            and the no-photo branch was the one place that broke it, on the
            argument that the plate *is* the naming when there is no
            photograph. That argument holds for a garage card, which has no
            heading of its own. It never held for the dashboard hero.

            So the empty band says the one thing the layout around it does not:
            that there is no photograph. Same line the card uses.

            single quiet row. So on a phone the line and its action sit side by
            side in about 64px, and from `sm` up — where the plate is a column
            standing beside the instrument rather than a band above it — they

              at the bottom of the card with zero context… the button reads as
              an orphan". A button in a bare strip does not say what the strip
              is.

              The real problem was never the label, it was 0.2em of tracking:
              at that width the two elements needed about 394px inside 358 and
