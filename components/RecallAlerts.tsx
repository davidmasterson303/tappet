            ── ⚠ There is no dismiss, and there should not be ─────────────────

            A close button stood here and set `dismissed`, hiding every open
            safety campaign on the vehicle for the rest of the session — one
            tap, no confirmation, no way back short of a reload, on the one
            panel in this product a reader must not miss. A design critique of
            the rendered page flagged it as "a dismissible × on a
            safety-critical recall banner".

            The affordance a reader actually needs is already here and is a
            statement about the world rather than about the panel: **Mark
            addressed**, per campaign, which records that the work was done and
            removes that campaign because it is genuinely finished. Dismiss
            removes the notice while leaving the recall open, which is the same
            distinction `health-claims.ts` draws between "checked, none found"
            and "never checked" — an absence of the message is not an absence
            of the thing.
