    ── The next rungs, rather than everything at once ────────────────────────

    David, 7 Aug: "we don't have to show 100% of the available mods for the car,
    just an assortment of next logical progression kind of thing."

    `nextRungs` orders by role — foundation, then control, then the parts that
    only exist to enable a bigger step — and returns a handful. The rest is not
    thrown away: it sits behind "Show the rest", because hiding a part the
    owner's own knowledge base offered would be a different complaint about the
    same screen.

    Only `completed` counts as done for the ladder. `not_interested` is in
    `doneMods` for display, but treating a declined mod as a completed step
    would advance the build on the strength of a refusal.
  */
  const completedNames = modTracking

    .map((t) => t.mod_name);

  /*
    The whole list in ladder order, then the first few as the rungs.

    `nextRungs` was called once for the top three and the remainder was rendered
    straight from `activeMods` — **which is database order.** So expanding
    "show the rest" produced two different orderings stacked in one list: three
    sorted by role, then everything else in whatever order the knowledge base
    happened to hold. On the WRX that put the downpipe (`enabling`) above the
    brakes (`control`), which is the exact inversion this module exists to
    prevent, visible only once expanded. Found by Cowork, 7 Aug.

        ── ⚠ UX-16 / D11 · the mod list is generated and said so nowhere ─────

        Every mod on this tab, its rationale, its ordering on the ladder and the
        details card behind it came out of a model. Neither client disclosed it:
        the dossier card above says "AI-researched insights", which is about the
        *dossier*, and this tab is reached by clicking away from that sentence —
        so a reader arrives at a ranked list of parts to buy for their car with
        no indication of where the ranking came from.

        `plan` rather than `consultant`: this is not an answer to a question, it
        is a suggestion from the car's typical profile, and the sentence says
        the thing that matters for a mod — that the owner's own history and
        manual come first.

        ⚠ The *schedule* tab is deliberately not given this string. It carries
        `SCHEDULE_BASIS_LABELS['generated-schedule']` instead, which is the
        module written for schedule provenance and is what mobile renders — two
        sentences making the same disclosure on one screen would be the
        duplication these modules exist to avoid.

        change in the same commit, and they are unused on purpose — see the
