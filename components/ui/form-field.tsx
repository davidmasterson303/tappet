/**
 * A text field with a real error state.
 *
 * Before this, the only feedback channel was a neutral hint line, so an
 * invalid field looked exactly like a valid one — the message changed colour
 * at most. That fails quietly for anyone scanning, and fails completely for
 * screen reader users, since nothing marked the field invalid.
 *
 * An error here carries all four signals together:
 *
 *   - a critical-coloured border, so the field is findable at a glance
 *   - an icon, so the state does not depend on colour alone
 *   - the message directly beneath, wired via aria-describedby
 *   - aria-invalid, so assistive tech announces it
 *
 * Error copy should say what is wrong AND what would be right. "Invalid VIN"
 * tells someone nothing; "A VIN is 17 characters — this one has 8" tells them
 * what to do next.

            `aria-invalid` is already set two lines above, and `.field` now styles
            the control off that attribute — so the colouring came for free and the
            hardcoded `red-400/60` was competing with `--critical-border`.

            Driving it off the attribute also means anything that sets it — a form
            library, native validation, a future component — gets the treatment,
            and a screen reader is told. The conditional class did the first half
            and never the second.
