    ── ⚠ The beltline belongs to the dashboard, and only to it ───────────────

    `.cockpit-belt` went on every page this layout wraps. Its own docblock is
    narrower than that: *"the cockpit beltline — concept 1c, and **the
    dashboard's** half of the rhyme… the signed-in dashboard stands in a car."*

    On the other three it is a brushed band crossing content it has no relation
    to, and four design critiques reported it there as a rendering defect —
    "lighter horizontal bands slice across the background behind the first
    card… that's not patina, it's a broken gradient". The phone was fixed by
    moving the band out of the box; the desktop kept it, and the reports kept
    coming from the pages that never wanted it.

    So it lit the room it was drawn for. The others took the plain ground,
    which is what they were being read as anyway.

    ── ⚠ And on 5 Sep it comes off the dashboard too ─────────────────────────

    That scoping held for one reason: every report had come from a page the
    band was never meant for. The dossier critique reported it from the
    dashboard — "a faint blurred full-bleed band remains behind the plate", and
    under Cut: "a blur doing an image's job; cut, do not replace."

    That is the fifth independent reading of a rendered page calling this an
    artefact, and the first from the room it was drawn for. The concept — the
    signed-in dashboard stands in a car — was good, and the page now has an
    actual photograph of one doing that job. A brushed gradient behind a night
    plate is competing with the thing it was standing in for.

              369px inside 390. */}
          {/*
            ── ⚠ The active tab was the one being cut — measured, 5 Sep ───────

            The note below records dropping the glyphs so all four tabs fit,
            and at 390px they do. At **375px** — iPhone SE, 13 mini, and every
            other 375pt device — they did not: the strip measured 394px against
            a 375px viewport, 19px over, and the tab pushed past the edge was
            whichever one was **active**. "Vehicle Info" sat with its right edge
            at 388px while being the page you were on.

            That is the worst tab to lose. The strip scrolls and `edge-fade-x`
            softens the cut, but the note below already settled what that is
            worth: *a scroll affordance is not discovery* — and it is less than
            that here, because the thing hidden is not a destination but your
            own location.

            12px comes off the strip and 16px off the tabs, which brings the
            row to ~366px and leaves 9px of air at 375. `min-h-[44px]` is
            untouched, so the tap target is unchanged.

                    ── `Link` with `prefetch`, and the history is worth keeping ─

                    These were `Link`, then briefly a plain `<a>`, and are `Link`
                    again. The round trip is recorded because the middle step was
                    based on a measurement error and somebody will otherwise
                    repeat it.

                    **8 Aug, reported:** tabs unreachable — clicking did nothing.
                    I "reproduced" it with browser automation and blamed a
                    hydration race in which `Link` calls `preventDefault()` before
                    the router can act, and swapped in a native `<a>`.

                    **That reproduction was an artifact.** The automated clicks
                    were going into a *background* tab —
                    `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'` — where a synthetic
                    click does not drive navigation. Every confusing result
                    followed from that, including clicks that "worked" only right
                    after a `javascript_tool` call.

                    What the native anchor did fix was real, though: tabs began
                    changing. What it cost was worse than the bug. Each switch
                    became a full page load, re-downloading and re-executing 26
                    chunks and re-hydrating — measured at ~2.7s of client boot —
                    when the server itself answers every one of these routes in
                    0.4–0.6s warm. The slowness was never the server.

                    `Link` transfers only the changed route segment and leaves
                    the shell, the nav and the vehicle header mounted. `prefetch`
                    pulls that segment during idle time after the page settles,
                    so the content is local before the click. That is the
                    "lazy-load the tab content" behaviour this needs, and it is
                    the framework's, not something to hand-roll.

                    **If tabs ever appear unreachable again, do not start with
                    this component.** Check the transition itself — a segment
                    fetch that hangs looks exactly like a dead control, because
                    `Link` cancels the browser's own navigation and shows nothing
                    while it waits. `prefetch` is also the mitigation for that:
                    a pre-warmed segment has nothing left to wait for.

                      Four tabs with a glyph and 32px of padding each measured
                      about 490px. On a 390px phone that put "Maintenance" half
                      off the right edge and "Vehicle Info" entirely off it —
                      and while the strip does scroll and `edge-fade-x` softens
                      the cut, a design critique of the rendered page reported
                      the fourth tab as something the mobile layout "gives no
                      hint exists". A scroll affordance is not discovery.

                      The glyphs are decoration here: every tab is a word, and
                      the word is what is read. Dropping them below `sm` and
                      tightening the padding fits all four, so the strip stops
                      overflowing at all. Unchanged from `sm` up, where there
                      was never a problem.

                      The note above already made the argument and stopped one
                      step short: "the glyphs are decoration here: every tab is
                      a word, and the word is what is read." It hid them below
                      `sm` to fix an overflow. The brief cuts them outright, and
                      the same sentence is the reason — a decoration that had to
                      be hidden to make the navigation fit was never earning its
                      place at any width.

                      `Icon` stays in the tab table: it is the obvious thing to
                      want back, and deleting it would take the mapping with it.

                      The active tab carried a cyan fill, cyan text *and* this

                      cannot be mistaken for a hover wash, and it leaves the
                      label to say what it says.

                      The text goes plain white rather than cyan for the same

                      the other half was that both sat on the same edge. Moving
                      it to the top edge separated them and put it on the far

                kinds in one weight: the model is the name, the year and make
                place it, the trim qualifies it.

                So: mono eyebrow for the placing, serif for the name, and the
                trim joins the eyebrow where it belongs. It is the treatment
                the garage cards and the landing page already use, and this was

                the "exactly one element per screen" licence with it. That rule

                `.display-serif` still exist for a marketing surface that wants
                them; this is not one.

                The note below still holds and is why the eyebrow carries the
                year and make.

                R11's finding still holds and is why the eyebrow carries the
                year and make: 36px of "2018 Honda Accord" wrapped to three
                lines in 279px before the trim appeared. The name alone does

                      ── ⚠ A word, after two conventions both failed ──────────

                      This was a pencil, revealed on hover and pinned visible on
                      touch — and two critiques called it "ambiguous grey
                      glyphs" and "unlabeled boxes". Replacing it with a dashed
                      rule under the value did no better: the next two called
                      that "dead affordances… tooltip styling on a touch device
                      where no tooltip can exist" and "broken tooltips/abbr
                      styling".

                      Both were right, and about the same thing. A dashed
                      underline means *definition*, a bare pencil means
                      *something*, and neither says what tapping does. The
                      control already carries the answer in its `aria-label`;
                      this is that label, made visible.

                      One affordance, one meaning, on every input type — no
                      convention for the reader to guess at.

                ── ⚠ This is not the health score, and it read like it was ───

                Two numbers with verdicts, on one screen, about one car: the
                dial says **61 / Fair** and this said **6/10 · Good**. They are
                different subjects — 61 is *this* car's condition from its own
                records, 6/10 is how the 2019 M3 fares as a model — and nothing
                on the screen said so. A design critique of the rendered page
                read them as the same fact contradicting itself, which is the
                only available reading when a label is one word long.

                Two changes, and the second matters more than the first:

                  - The label names the subject. "Reliability" beside a car's
                    dashboard is naturally read as *this car's*.
                  - The verdict chip is gone. "Good" next to "Fair" is the
                    contradiction in its sharpest form, and the chip was the
                    one element on the row asserting a judgement — the other
                    three state readings and let the reader judge. The figure
                    keeps its `/10`, which is what makes it a scale rather than
                    a score out of a hundred read wrong.

                It used to sit between AVG and RELIABILITY, which split the
                strip: three label-over-value readings with a word wedged
                into the middle of them. A critique of the rendered page
                called it "breaking the label-over-value rhythm", and the
                cost is that the eye stops counting halfway along a row
                whose whole job is to be counted.

                Moving it to the end lets MILEAGE, AVG and RELIABILITY run
                unbroken and leaves the one word at the end of the line,
                where a word can sit without interrupting anything.

                pair took its own row with an empty column beside it.

                The other three stats are label-over-value because their values
                are bare numbers. This one is a word, and a word does not need
                a word above it.
