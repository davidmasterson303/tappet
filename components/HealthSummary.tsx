 *
 *   - the **measured** line is arithmetic over rows the owner can go and
 *     count, assembled by `driversForVehicle`;
 *   - the **claim** is prose from the model, gated by `healthClaim`.
 *
 * The measured line is first and takes the brighter ink. That ordering was the
 * whole argument of the panel this replaces and it survives intact: nothing
 * makes the score a function of the drivers, so when the two disagree the
 * checkable half should be the half read first. What changed is that they are
 * one list instead of two — the subject appeared twice before, once with a
 * number and once with an icon, and a reader had to notice they were the same
 * topic.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Not terms in a sum, and this must not imply they are ──────────────────
 *
 * `health_score` comes from the model; the scores here are computed from rows.
 * So they explain the *subject* without arithmetically explaining the *total*,
 * and they are laid out as peers: no plus signs, no "= 74", no ordering that
 * suggests one contributes more. `health-drivers.ts` carries the same warning
 * at the source and `HealthDrivers.tsx` on mobile makes the same choices —
 * deliberately its twin rather than a second design, because a driver that
 * reads one way on the phone and another on the web is this codebase's most

                    the screen — "no studio ships a trust product that argues
                    with itself two lines apart".

                    The first fix neutralised only the rows whose claim said
                    attention, and the next round read the result exactly as it
                    looked: "Maintenance 97 is grey, Mileage 91 is green,
                    Recalls 35 is grey. Three scores, two treatments, zero

                    product rather than convenient for the layout: **the
                    overall score is the verdict, and it is the only thing that
                    carries the band's colour.** These are measurements that
                    explain it — `health-drivers.ts` is emphatic that they are
                    not terms in a sum — and a measurement painted in verdict
                    ink is a second opinion the system never formed.

                    `null` keeps its muted ink, because that is a different
                    statement: not a quiet measurement, but no measurement.

                than a reading" — and the hero was rendering that same string

                screen carried one paragraph twice, verbatim, within a single

                It resolves here rather than in the hero, and the deciding

                by tidying.

          D5 specifies "one row per contributing factor with its point delta".
          There is no delta to show. `vehicle_health_summary` holds a single
          `health_score` int plus prose — `summary`, `maintenance_status`,
          `issues_overview`, `recall_status` — and two string arrays,
          `red_flags` and `recommendations`. Nothing anywhere attributes points
          to a factor.

          Printing "-8" beside a red flag would be inventing a number about
          someone's car and presenting it as computed, which is the same defect
          as the consultant's old provenance badges: a confident claim the
          system never made. Deltas need a scoring breakdown emitted by
          whatever produces the score. That is real work, server-side, and it
          is not this ticket.

          So each factor gets a severity icon and its text, and the rows carry
          no magnitude they cannot justify.

          wrong for a product whose voice is a service record rather than a
          notification tray. On desktop each one stretched 1100px around a
          single line of text.

          The severity has not been softened; it has been moved off the
          furniture and onto the ink. One panel, hairline-divided rows, the
          critical red on the glyph and a red rule down the edge that says

              side of a 12px radius bends around two corners and stops, which
              looks like a clipping bug rather than an emphasis.

              The severity lives on the glyphs, where it is per-row and
              accurate. The panel is furniture and matches the factor rows
              below it, which is the point: one panel treatment, not one per

          titled "Maintenance" with an orange alert icon reading "Brake fluid
          overdue". Same word, twice, in two colours, disagreeing — and
          "Recalls" appeared twice the same way.

          The old comment here defended the order (computed above generated,

          measured sentence still comes first and the model's claim follows it.
          What the ordering could not fix was that they were two *lists*, so
          the same subject was two entries and the reader had to work out that
          "Maintenance 97" and "Maintenance ⚠" were one topic.

          ⚠ And they can genuinely disagree — nothing makes the score a
          function of the drivers, and on the seeded M3 they do: the measured
          line says nothing is overdue among the six items it can check while
          the model says the brake fluid is. Putting them in one row does not
          resolve that, and is not meant to. It makes it visible, in the one
