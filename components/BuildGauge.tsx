 * How far this build has come, on the cluster dial.

 * ── Why a sibling of `ClusterGauge` and not a variant of it ─────────────────
 *
 * The health gauge is hardwired to health semantics, correctly: it calls
 * `useHealthBand(score)`, announces "Health score 61 out of 100 — Fair", and
 * paints low readings red. **On a build dial a low reading is not bad, it is
 * stock.** Reusing it would render an unmodified car as a critical failure and
 * announce it to a screen reader as one.
 *
 * So the geometry is shared through `@wellkept/core/cluster-geometry` and the
 * *meaning* is not. Two gauges in one cluster, one set of numbers describing
 * the glass.
 *
 * ── The needle never reaches the end, and that is the argument ──────────────
 *
 * `buildPosition` maps accumulated effort through an asymptote, so no amount of
 * work pegs the dial. A progress bar that fills says "you are finished"; this
 * says "there is always something more you can do", which is the thing David
 * asked the product to express. It is made in glass rather than in copy.

          launch, very nearly unreachable.

          `--build-redline` is deliberately hotter and more orange-shifted than
          `--critical`. A redline that matched the alert red would be read
