/**
 * The first-load intro curtain: a garage door that lifts to reveal the page.
 *
 * Replaces three things that did not work together. `GarageDoorAnimation` and
 * `GarageDoorLayer` were dead code on every branch — the second rendered
 * `children` twice, concurrently, for the whole 1.5s of its exit, so the entire
 * page below it mounted twice with duplicate effects and duplicate fetches. The
 * third, `LandingHero`, was live but ran its curtain on every visit, from a
 * 1.41 MB JPEG, with no reduced-motion check.
 *
 * Three rules hold this one together:
 *
 *   1. **`children` is rendered exactly once**, and never inside the curtain.
 *      The page below is the page below whether the door is up or not; the
 *      curtain is a sibling that covers it. That is the fix for the double
 *      mount, and it is structural rather than careful.
 *   2. **The curtain is server-rendered and CSS-gated**, so it covers the
 *      viewport in the first paint. Nothing about it waits on a chunk. The old
 *      version was `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` racing a 600ms timer, and
 *      lost the race silently — no error, just no intro.
 *   3. **The lift ends on `animationend`**, not on a hand-copied duration.

        therefore raised a second curtain — pressing a link and being met by
        another closed garage door, which reads as a dead link.

        The two cannot disagree within a load anyway: the script computes its
        answer before `markPlayed()` has run, so it reads the same unplayed flag
        this does. The attribute's job is narrower than it was given — it exists

    a door.

    True from the moment the door *starts* moving, not when it finishes.

    Waiting for `gone` was worse than not waiting at all: the door takes 2.6s to
    travel, uncovering the page as it goes, so the visitor would watch an empty
    garage slide into view and then have the cards pop in after the door had
    cleared. Starting on the lift means the content arrives *as* the door
    reveals it, which is the beat the door exists to set up. While the door is
    still closed the page is behind something opaque, so nothing is lost there.

        `display: contents` so the wrapper is invisible to layout — the page
