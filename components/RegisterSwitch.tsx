/**
 * The way back — v8 §6.
 *
 * Onboarding asks a single yes/no about modifications in the first sixty
 * seconds, and "not interested" hides an entire surface. **That answer has to
 * be reversible in both directions**, which is what lets the question stay a
 * yes/no rather than something that must be got right first time.
 *
 * A one-way version of this already existed here — an underlined text link
 * reading "Interested in modifications for this car? Turn them on", shown only
 * while the surface was hidden. It was right about the problem and incomplete
 * in three ways: it could not turn the surface back OFF, it was an 11px
 * underline rather than a control, and it read as an advertisement rather than
 * a capability.
 *
 * ── Why this is not in the garage header ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The design system asks for this in the garage header and the account screen.
 * **Neither fits this data model**: the setting is `vehicles
 * .performance_mindedness`, so it is per-CAR, not per-person. A garage header
 * carries no vehicle, and in a two-car garage a single switch there would
 * silently mean one of them. The dossier is the only surface where the
 * question "show modifications for *this* car" is well-formed, so that is
 * where it lives until the column moves to the profile.
 *
 * ── The copy rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `stock` is "not now", never "never" — so the label states the action rather
 * than pitching it, and is symmetrical in both directions.
