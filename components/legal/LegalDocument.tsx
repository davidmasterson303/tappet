/**
 * The shell both legal documents sit in.
 *
 * ── Why these read differently to the rest of the app ───────────────────────
 *
 * Every other surface is dark, dense and built for glancing. These are the two
 * pages somebody reads in full, slowly, usually because they are deciding
 * whether to trust the product with a photograph of their driveway. So the
 * measure is narrow, the line height is loose, and there is nothing in the
 * margin competing for attention.
 *
 * `cc-marketing-0001` — plain and direct — governs the words. It applies here
 * more than anywhere: a privacy policy written in the register of a privacy
 * policy is one nobody finishes, and an unread policy is not consent.
 *
 * ── The date is shown, deliberately ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A legal page with no date cannot be checked against anything. Showing it
 * invites the reader to notice when it last moved, which is the point.
