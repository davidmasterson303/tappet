        The 3:2 identity plate, and it renders unconditionally — CC-142 §2.

        ── This supersedes a v7 decision, deliberately ───────────────────────
        v7 shrank this to a 96px strip that appeared *only* when a photograph
        existed, on the reasoning that "a card that is complete without a photo
        is better than a card that is never allowed to lack one." That reasoning
        was sound, and its premise was that the no-photo state looked broken —
        an empty plate, a placeholder icon, or a stock car.

        CC-142 removes the premise. The no-photo state is now a deterministic
        make-derived field with the vehicle named on it, which is a finished
        design rather than an absence, so it earns the space v7 correctly denied
        it. Restoring the plate without `VehicleIdentity` would reinstate the
        bug v7 was avoiding — the two changes only make sense together.

        The focal-point crop is gone with the `cover` fit that needed it: the
        plate contains the photo rather than cropping it, so there is no crop to
        anchor. `focal_point_x/y` still exist and are still edited in
        VehiclePhotoUploadDialog; nothing reads them here any more.

            `--ring-bad` and `--ring-warn`, so this ribbon was a third source of
            truth for a ramp that already had two, and it is why the landing
            page still rendered salmon after the tokens moved: an inline `rgb()`
            cannot be migrated by changing a token, and nothing failed to warn
            anybody.

            Both are sodium under brief B3, which allows two hues and asks for

          front page is a self-own.

          cut off in the middle of a word.

        {/*
          ── ⚠ CUT by the design critique, 5 Sep. Restoring it is one block ───

          This rendered `firstSentence(healthSummary?.summary)` — the lead
          sentence of the health summary, under the dial.

          The critique's argument: "the dossier is one click away; cutting them
          lets year/model/dial lead and tightens the card to instrument
          height." Which is the same argument the note below already made for
          taking only the *first* sentence, followed one step further.

          **This is a content change, not a styling one, and it is the only one
          in the whole design pass.** A garage card no longer says anything in
          prose about the car's condition; the dial and the recall ribbon carry
          it, and the sentence lives on the dossier. If that is the wrong trade,
          the reversal is: render `firstSentence(healthSummary?.summary)` here
          as a muted paragraph at the small step, capped to the measure — and
          restore the `@wellkept/core/summary-text` import, which went with it
          rather than being left dangling.

          ⚠ Do not paste the removed JSX into this comment to preserve it.
          `text-contrast-floor.test.ts` counts class tokens before and after
          stripping comments and fails when stripping eats more than five,
          which is how it proves it is reading markup rather than prose. Two
          separate edits in this design pass turned it red exactly that way.

          ── ⚠ A complete sentence, not a clamped paragraph ────────────────

          Kept because it is the reason `firstSentence` exists, and whoever
          restores the line needs it. That paragraph once ran
          the whole summary under `line-clamp-2`, so the card ended mid-clause
          with an ellipsis butted against the text's own punctuation —
          "...separates a healthy car from a costly one...." On a product whose
          pitch is "every invoice read", an unfinished sentence on the front
          page is a self-own. `firstSentence` takes the lead sentence whole; do
          not reach for a clamp again if this comes back.
