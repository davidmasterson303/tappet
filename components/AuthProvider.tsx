/**
 * The app's one auth-state listener.
 *
 * This was a stub: a context that returned `{ user: null, session: null }`
 * unconditionally, with `OnboardingWizard` as its only consumer. It is now
 * what task 1.6 asks for — a single subscription to `onAuthStateChange`,
 * mounted once in the root layout, that notices when a session ends and acts
 * on it. Per-page listeners were the alternative and would have given every
 * page its own slightly different answer.
 *
 * Two behaviours, and the second is the one with a history:
 *
 *   1. A session that ends — sign-out elsewhere, a revoked or expired refresh
 *      token — drops the query cache and, on a protected route, returns the
 *      user to /login. Without this they sit on a page whose queries quietly
 *      start failing.
 *   2. An anonymous visitor is untouched. Supabase reports "no session" to
 *      the signed-out demo visitor on every page load; only a session that
 *      *was* live and then went away counts as expiry. The policy for that
 *      distinction is `lib/auth-session.ts`, kept pure so it can be tested
 *      without a browser.

  /*
    A signed-in user does not sit on the demo garage.

    The policy is `resolveRoute`'s, shared with the middleware rather than
    restated here — but middleware cannot apply this one: `/` is deliberately not
    in its matcher, because matching it would put a getUser() round trip in front
    of every anonymous load of the demo. So the rule lands here, where a session
    is already known and costs an anonymous visitor nothing.

    `replace`, not `push`: the demo garage should not be a back-button stop for
    someone who was never meant to be on it.

    Waits for `loading` to settle. Acting while the session is still resolving
    would send every anonymous visitor to /garage on first paint and bounce them
    straight back off it by the middleware, which is a visible flicker on the
    page that matters most.
