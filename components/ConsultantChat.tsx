 * What the model was actually given.
 *
 * ── Two bugs, in order ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * First version lowercased the assistant's own reply and keyword-matched it:
 * `content.includes('oil')` produced a "Service records" chip,
 * `includes('recall')` produced "Issue history". The chips asserted what the
 * system had read, and nothing about them was connected to what it read. A
 * reply that merely said the word "recall" claimed issue history had been
 * consulted whether or not a single row existed. Worse, `includes('mod')`
 * matches "model", "modern", "moderate" and "modify", so a reply mentioning
 * "the 2019 model" earned a "Mod profile" badge — that fires on ordinary copy,
 * not edge cases.
 *
 * Second version fixed that by computing the chips from the context collections
 * this component posted to `sendConsultantMessage`. Honest at the time. Then
 * the context moved server-side into `loadConsultantContext`, the server began
 * ignoring what was posted and loading its own — and these chips went on
 * describing the discarded payload. A provenance claim whose evidence had been
 * cut away underneath it, which is the same failure as the "AI Extracted"
 * badge removed in `9597869`.
 *
 * ── What it claims now ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The server returns `contextKinds` from the context it actually loaded. The
 * claim is "this was loaded and put in front of the model" — checkable where it
 * is made, and no longer checkable here, which is precisely why it moved. It is
 * still not "the model used this", so the row stays prefixed "Based on".
 *
 * Stored on the message at send time, because context is a property of the
 * turn, not of the transcript. Messages replayed from a saved session carry no
 * `sources` and therefore show no chips: the honest rendering of "we no longer
 * know" is to claim nothing, not to recompute from today's garage and backdate
 * it onto an old answer.
 *
 * ── Where the words themselves live ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `@wellkept/core/consultant-context-kinds`, since the Expo advisor screen
 * renders this same row. The labels are a provenance claim, so a second copy on
 * the phone would let the two clients describe one answer differently. Only the
 * icons below are web — Lucide has no React Native build here.

                      on the web as prose beginning with a hyphen.

                                `tabular-nums`, and the reason is what these
                                amounts contain.

                                They are not pure figures — they carry words
                                and ranges: "$800 all-in", "~$1,900-2,100".
                                Tabular figures give every glyph the width of a
                                digit, **including the hyphen**, so "all-in"
                                rendered with a gap either side of its dash and
                                a critique reported it as "$800 all - in".
                                `.num` adds the register's negative tracking on
                                top, which was never meant for prose.

                                Tabular buys decimal alignment, and these are
                                right-aligned against a rule instead — the
                                column lines up on its edge, which is what a
                                printed estimate does with mixed amounts.
