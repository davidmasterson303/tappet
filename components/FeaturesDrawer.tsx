/*
 * Nine features, rewritten.
 *
 * The previous copy had one rhythm and used it nine times: a promise, then
 * "Well Kept" as the subject of a sentence explaining the promise, then a
 * closing flourish about darkness or gloveboxes. Read end to end it flattened —
 * every item sounded equally important, which is the same as none of them being.
 *
 * Two rules for the rewrite. Headings state what you get, not how it feels.
 * Bodies say the concrete thing — the actual data source, the actual artefact
 * that comes out — and stop, because a reader who opened a feature list is
 * already interested and does not need selling to twice.
