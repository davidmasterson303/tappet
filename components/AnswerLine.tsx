 * ── Why this is its own file ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It lived inside `ConsultantChat` as a local `renderMarkdownLine`, which made
 * it **untestable** — that component is a 1,000-line client component pulling in
 * react-query, the toast system and half a dozen dialogs, so nothing was going
 * to mount it for four lines of mapping.
 *
 * That mattered on 24 Aug, when the mapping went from two branches to four
 * (FN-14: single-asterisk emphasis and the `***both***` case). The tokeniser has
 * 23 cases; the *element* mapping had none, and the mobile renderer of the same
 * four branches is covered. A typo here would have rendered nothing and shown
 * nothing wrong.
 *
 * ── Why `<em>` and `<strong>` rather than font classes ──────────────────────
 *
 * The emphasis has to survive for a screen reader as well as for the eye. A
 * `font-style: italic` span reads identically to plain text, which is the same
 * failure as the asterisks it replaced — one you can see and not hear, the other
 * you can hear and not see.
 *
 * ⚠ Only the drawing is web. React Native has no `<strong>`, which is why the
 * tokenising is in core and this is not.

 * Split out when the consultant moved to `parseAnswer`, which hands back the

 * re-parse at that point, and re-joining one so this could split it again is
 * how a renderer starts disagreeing with its parser.
