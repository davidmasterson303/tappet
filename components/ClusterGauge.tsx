/*
 * The health score as an instrument cluster, not a progress donut.
 *
 * Built to `docs/roadmap.md` item 7 (concept 2a). The reference is a modern
 * flagship cluster at night, and its grammar is specific: a near-black face, a
 * thin luminous arc open at the bottom, fine ticks with the numbers *on* the
 * majors, one accent hue used as light rather than as fill, tabular numerals,
 * and a needle sweep at ignition. What it never does is close the ring — a
 * 360° track has no start and no end, so it reads as a loading spinner rather
 * than a scale.
 *
 * The 270° opening is what buys the ticks. On a closed donut there is nowhere
 * to put 40 / 60 / 80 without them colliding with the fill, which is why the
 * ring this replaces had no marks at all: it could show that a score was
 * large, but not that 68 sits one tick past the boundary where "Needs
 * attention" becomes "Fair". The linear band scale this hero used to carry
 * made the same argument in its own comment; the ticks have simply moved onto
 * the arc, where the reading and the scale are one object.
 *
 * ── Geometry ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * viewBox 0 0 200 178, centre (100,100), arc radius 70, open 90° at the
 * bottom. The height is 178 rather than 200 deliberately: the arc bottoms out
 * at y≈152, and the 26 units left below it are exactly the readout's line.
 * Cropping there is what stops the dial floating in a square of nothing.
 *
 * A score maps to an angle by `2.7 * score - 135` degrees from twelve
 * o'clock: 2.7 = 270/100, and -135 puts zero at the bottom-left end. Every
 * rotating part — needle, ticks, labels — uses that one expression, so nothing
 * can drift out of register with the track.
 *
 * The track path is `M 50.5 149.5 A 70 70 0 1 1 149.5 149.5`; those endpoints
 * are the same formula at 0 and 100, and the large-arc flag is 1 because 270°
 * exceeds a semicircle — the flag most hand-written arcs get wrong. The lit
 * portion reuses the identical `d` with `pathLength="100"`, so the dasharray
 * is literally the score: no circumference arithmetic, and no chance of the
 * fill and the track describing different curves.
 *
 * Caps are butt, not round. A round cap adds half a stroke width of arc at
 * each end, so a score of 0 would still paint a visible stub and every reading
 * would sit ~2% long. On a dial with ticks that error is legible.

  ── ⚠ Two numerals, and the second attempt at this ────────────────────────

  Six numerals around a 160px arc is a scale competing with its own reading,
  and a critique of the rendered dashboard named the clutter first.

  The first reduction kept the *meaningful* points — the two ends plus the
  three where the verdict changes, 40/60/80 — and dropped 20. The next round of
  the same critique caught what that did: "tick labels sit at irregular
  positions (40/60 crowding the top, 80 alone on the right)". Of course they
  do. Removing one number from an evenly spaced set does not make the set
  meaningful, it makes it look mismeasured, and on an instrument face — where
  regularity *is* the craft — that is worse than the clutter it fixed.

  So the numerals are the two ends of the scale, which is what a scale's
  numerals are for, and the band boundaries keep saying what they say the way
  an instrument says it: with a heavier tick. The verdict is written out under
  the dial in words, which is more legible than a number a reader has to
  compare against three remembered thresholds.

  Every major still gets a mark, so the geometry is even all the way round.

              It ran to the exact centre and met a 5px hub drawn over it —
              which is what a toy speedometer looks like, and a design critique
              of the rendered page said so. The hub existed for a reason worth
              recording: without it the needle crossed the digits. It is not
              needed now because the needle no longer reaches them.

              What replaces it is a short marker riding just inside the track,
              at the reading. A full-length needle floating without a pivot was
              worse than either — it read as a stray line across the middle
              rather than as something indicating a position on the arc.

              And it clears the well completely, which is what lets the reading
              move into it.

          On the hero it sits on the line the 178-tall viewBox exists to make,
          below the hub and between the 0 and 100 labels, exactly where a tach
          puts its digital readout. Centring it in the well is not available
          once there is a hub: the needle would cross the digits, which is what
          it did before the hub came back.

          No "/100". No instrument prints its own denominator when the scale is
          drawn around it and both ends are numbered. The full reading is in the
          container's aria-label, where the dial cannot be seen.

          The comment this replaces was accurate about its own constraint —
          *"centring it in the well is not available once there is a hub: the
          needle would cross the digits"* — and the constraint is gone with the
          hub. The reading is the instrument's subject; sitting it between the
          0 and 100 labels made it a caption to the dial instead of the point
          of it.

          108 rather than 100: the arc is open at the bottom, so the optical
          centre of the drawn shape is above the geometric one, and type
          centred on 100 rides high in it.
