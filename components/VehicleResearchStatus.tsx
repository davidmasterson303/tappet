/**
 * Says what the dossier does not know yet, and does something about it.
 *
 * ── The two things this exists to prevent ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Onboarding no longer blocks on a ~23s research call, so a brand-new vehicle
 * reaches its dashboard before the AI has said anything about it. That trade
 * is only honest if the gap is *visible*. A vehicle showing a blank dossier
 * with no explanation is the §21 provenance problem in a new costume — a UI
 * implying data it does not have. So: say "researching", and mean it.
 *
 * And when research fails, the user gets a button. A silent empty dossier with
 * no way forward is worse than a slow one.
 *
 * ── Why the work is started from here ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §11 records the wishlist recompute being fire-and-forget on a serverless
 * platform, where work started after a response "may be frozen along with it".
 * Onboarding therefore does **not** kick this off and walk away. This
 * component does, from a live request the browser is holding open, so the work
 * has an owner.
 *
 * The `startedRef` guard matters: React 18 StrictMode double-invokes effects
 * in development, and without it every dashboard visit would fire two Gemini
 * research calls — the unmetered-spend bug §3 already records once.
 */
/**
 * How often to ask, and for how long.
 *
 * Four seconds against a measured ~60s of work is about fifteen reads of one
 * column — cheap enough not to think about, frequent enough that the spinner
 * does not outlive the dossier by much. Three minutes is the ceiling: research
 * has three attempts with backoff behind a 30s timeout each, so a run still
 * going at three minutes is not going to finish.

  /**
   * Start the research, then ask the database how it went.
   *
   * ── ⚠ Why the action's return value is no longer the answer ───────────────
   *
   * 22 Aug, a real run: a complete dossier and 24 NHTSA recalls were written
   * in about sixty seconds, and this component showed the failure state with a
   * retry button. The request outlived its response, `enrichVehicle` came back
   * with no body, and `result.success` threw on `undefined` —
   * `RESEARCH_STATUS:THREW`, which is what the log said.
   *
   * The work was never the problem. **The answer had nowhere to arrive.**
   * Awaiting one long response gives the client exactly one chance to hear the
   * outcome, spent on the leg most likely to be cut — and the outcome is
   * sitting in `research_status` the entire time.
   *
   * So the call still happens, because §11's rule stands: work started and
   * abandoned on a serverless platform may be frozen with the response, so it
   * needs a request that owns it. What changed is that its return value is now
   * a *hint*, and the database is the verdict.
   *
   * ⚠ A rejected call is deliberately not a failure any more. The most likely
   * reason for one is the timeout above, and that happens while the work is
   * succeeding.
