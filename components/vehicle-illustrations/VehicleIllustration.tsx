/**
 * The shared frame and the proportion grid every vehicle illustration draws
 * against.
 *
 * ── Why a grid ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Pass 1 gave all twelve shapes the same stance, and at 48px sedan / coupe /
 * sports / small SUV / wagon / generic were interchangeable. Body type is
 * carried by **height and stance**, not by detail — detail is the first thing
 * to disappear when the art is 48px wide. So the grid is defined here, once,
 * and every silhouette is seated on it. Per-file magic numbers are what let the
 * set drift in the first place.
 *
 * Three roof heights and two ground clearances give six stance combinations,
 * which is enough to separate the whole set structurally before a single line
 * of detail is drawn.
 *
 * ── Colour rules, enforced where they are used ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * - **No literal colour values anywhere in this directory.** Every fill and
 *   stroke resolves through a design token, so a theme change propagates and a
 *   warm tint cannot be invented locally. `illustration-tokens.test.ts` fails
 *   the build if a hex, rgb(), oklch() or a raw hsl() appears here.
 * - **Cyan is reserved for actions.** The "Add a photo" affordance on the card
 *   *is* the action; it lives in the card component, not in here.
 * - **The health ramp means a health score** and nothing else.
 * - **Nothing identifiable.** If a car person could name a production model
 *   from one of these, it is wrong and gets redrawn.

 * is scale-invariant — 2.4 at a 200-wide render is 9.4 at 780.
 *
 * The real risk at capture size is therefore the **inverse**: a weight tuned to
 * survive 48px, where it renders sub-pixel at 0.58, can read heavy once the
 * drawing is the size of a phone screen.
 *
 * So this is a default rather than a constant, and picking a capture weight is

        The floor contact.

        ⚠ Added 17 Aug on Design's capture review: *"the native bay already
        reflects its instruments in the floor plane; a car drawing with no
        shadow and no reflection is the one object in that room that is not in
        the room."* Exactly right — the ground **line** anchored the set to each
        other, and nothing sat the car on the surface.

        An ellipse under the sills rather than a cast shadow with a direction.
        The bay is lit from above and slightly forward, so a directional shadow
        would have to agree with `BayRoom`'s gradient at every size, and would
        disagree the moment either moved. Contact is the honest part of a
        shadow, and it is the part that does the work.

        Hidden from assistive tech with everything else here — the `<title>`
        carries the whole meaning of this drawing.

          survives that; a hairline does not. And an underlight is the more
          literal answer to "so it sits in the bay instead of floating on it" —

        The vehicle's own hue, as **light on the body rather than paint**.

        ⚠ This was a fill until 17 Aug — `fill={tint} opacity={0.22}` over the
        graphite — and Design's capture review rejected that shape: *"Light,
        never fill — the hue may not carry a health value."* The distinction is
        not stylistic. A filled body is a coloured object, and a coloured object
        on a card that also carries a health ramp invites the colour to be read
        as a reading. A rim leaves the body graphite and puts the hue where a
        light source would put it.

        So it is a stroke along the body's own outline, drawn over the panel:
        the top edge catches it because the bay is lit from above, and the
        weight is under the structural line so it reads as light on an edge
        rather than as a second outline.

        `paint-order: stroke` is deliberately not used — it would put the hue
        *behind* the body and lose the edge entirely.
