/**
 * A dashboard section that can be folded away, and remembers that it was.
 *
 * The dashboard grew by stacking: hero, recalls, research status, health
 * report, health history, dossier, wishlist — every one of them expanded, all
 * of the time, on a screen whose first job is to tell you whether the car needs
 * attention. Most of that is reference material you consult occasionally and
 * scroll past constantly.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does:
 *
 *   - **Remembers per section and per vehicle.** Collapsing the dossier on one
 *     car should not collapse it on another, and it certainly should not come
 *     back open on every navigation. Keyed storage: `localStorage`, read in a
 *     lazy initialiser, with writes wrapped in try/catch because storage can be
 *     unavailable outright — Safari private browsing throws on `setItem`.
 *   - **Renders children only when open.** These sections mount charts, run
 *     count-up animations and fire queries; keeping a collapsed one mounted
 *     would pay for work nobody asked to see. The trade is that expanding is a
 *     fresh mount rather than an instant reveal, which is the right way round.
 *   - **Says what is inside when closed.** A collapsed section with only a title
 *     is a mystery box. `summary` is the one line that survives folding — a
 *     score, a count, "3 open items" — so the fold still carries information.

    ── Being linked to opens the section ─────────────────────────────────────

    `#health-report` in the URL is a request to read the health report, and
    honouring the scroll while leaving the panel shut answers it with a closed
    drawer. The hero's "What's driving this score" link is exactly that case.

    ⚠ Ordered after the effect above deliberately: both run on mount, and this
    one has to win. A reader who collapsed the section last week has `false` in
    storage, and following a link to it now is the more recent instruction.

    `hashchange` covers the second click. The browser does not re-fire it for a
    hash that is already current, so a link followed twice would otherwise
    scroll and do nothing — which is fine here, because by then the section is
    already open.

            intervals" rendered as "5 known issues · 7 s…". An ellipsis in a

            says nothing.

            Given its own line it fits whole, and the truncation stays as the
