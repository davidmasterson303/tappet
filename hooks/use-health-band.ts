/**
 * Health-score banding, dressed for the web.
 *
 * Two components render a health score on the dashboard — `DiagnosticHero`
 * (the large hero display) and `HealthSummary`'s `ScoreRing`. They previously
 * banded independently, with DiagnosticHero missing the ≥40 boundary entirely,
 * so the same score could be styled two different ways on one screen.
 *
 * **The thresholds and wording now live in `@wellkept/core/health-band`**, so
 * the Expo garage bands a score the same way this does. Neither of the two
 * fields added here can cross that boundary: `color` is a CSS custom property
 * resolved by globals.css, and `textClass` is a Tailwind class. This module is
 * the web's presentation of a shared judgement — it must not redefine the
 * judgement.
 *
 * The ramp is deliberately not the chip/badge semantics. Reusing those made a
 * mid-score ring read as "another issue chip" among the real ones — these are
 * the same four bands desaturated ~15% so a score reads as a gauge.
