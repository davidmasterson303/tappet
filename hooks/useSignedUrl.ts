/**
 * The client half of the private-bucket convention.
 *
 * Columns that used to hold a URL now hold a storage path (`storedUrl` in
 * `@wellkept/core/storage-paths`). Nothing renderable can be persisted: a
 * public URL never resolves against a private bucket, and a signed one
 * expires. So the exchange happens per read, here.
 *
 * ── Why a query and not a `useEffect` ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The garage renders one card per vehicle, each holding its own photo URL.
 * With an effect that is N server round trips per mount and N more on every
 * remount. React Query keys the exchange on the stored URL, so the cache is
 * shared across cards and survives navigation between the garage and a
 * dashboard — the same photo is signed once, not once per component.
 *
 * `staleTime` is deliberately well under the hour a signed URL lives. A cached
 * entry handed out at 55 minutes would be technically fresh and about to break
 * in the user's hands; refreshing at 30 leaves the whole second half of the
 * window as slack.

 *     through — no request is made);
 *   - `undefined` while a stored path is being signed, and if signing fails.
 *
 * Pending and failed collapse into `undefined` on purpose. Call sites render a
 * photo or they don't; there is no third state a broken `<img>` improves on,
 * and the alternative — showing a fallback for the ~200ms before the real
 * photo arrives — is a visible swap on every page load.
