 * ── ⚠ The window between a deploy and a migration ────────────────────────
 *
 * `vehicles.plate_key` arrives with `20260912010000`, which David applies by
 * hand. PostgREST rejects the *whole* query for one unknown column (`42703`)
 * — CLAUDE.md §1 records the dashboard that never showed a recall for exactly
 * this reason — so naming the column in `GARAGE_COLUMNS` would empty both
 * garages on every deploy that lands before the migration does. The column
 * is asked for here instead, and on `42703` the query is re-run without it:
 * the cards render, the plate is simply not there yet. Same shape as
 * `lib/nhtsa-row.ts`. Delete the retry once the migration is confirmed live
 * (`node scripts/check-migrations.mjs --pending`).
