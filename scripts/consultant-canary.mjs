/**
 * The consultant canary — the half of the gate that actually closes §22.
 *
 * ── Why a promote-time gate is not enough ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `CREWCHIEF_ROUNDTRIP_GATE_DESIGN.md` is blunt about this and it is the one
 * thing to take from the whole document: **the §22 outage did not arrive with
 * a deploy.** The key went stale while the code sat still, and the demo was a
 * frozen upload. A promote-time gate only runs when you promote, and nobody
 * was promoting.
 *
 * So this runs on a schedule against the **live demo**, not against a
 * candidate build, and asks the same question the promote gate asks. It is the
 * piece that notices a credential dying on a Tuesday.
 *
 *   node scripts/consultant-canary.mjs                    # the live demo
 *   node scripts/consultant-canary.mjs https://<site>
 *
 * Exit codes are deliberately distinct, so a scheduler can treat them
 * differently:
 *
 *   0  good      — the consultant answered with vehicle-specific facts
 *   1  broken    — ours. Page someone
 *   2  degraded  — Gemini is unavailable. Notice, but do not treat as ours
 *   3  unable    — the canary itself could not run (no secret, unreachable)
 *
 * Conflating 1 and 2 is how a monitor teaches people to ignore it: an alert
 * that fires on someone else's outage gets muted, and a muted alert is worse
 * than none.
