/**
 * Check every symbol CREWCHIEF_FEATURES.md names against the tree.
 *
 * ── Why this is a script and not a test ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `CREWCHIEF_FEATURES.md` is not in this repository — it lives in the iCloud
 * docs folder, and `FeaturesDrawer.tsx` carries none of its pitch copy. So the
 * build cannot see the artifact, and the obvious model
 * (`provenance-claims.test.ts`, which fails the build on an unsubstantiated
 * claim rendered by the app) cannot be copied here. Making that possible means
 * moving the file into the repo, which is a real decision: it is the document
 * that gets sent to other people.
 *
 * Until then this runs by hand, like `audit-rls.mjs`.
 *
 * ── What it can and cannot catch ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It catches **drift**: a named function, table or path that no longer exists.
 * That is the failure mode that produced ten stale `lib/` paths after the
 * Phase 2.4 move into `@wellkept/core` — including `lib/onboarding.ts`, which
 * the knowledge base corrected on 28 Jul while this file kept the old path.
 *
 * It cannot catch a **false capability claim**, which is a semantic statement
 * about what the product does. Two of those have been found in this file by
 * reading it: "with the invoice attached", and "compare that against what you
 * were quoted" — the latter being where roadmap task 2.98b came from, a task
 * costed and sequenced off a sentence rather than off the tree. Those need a
 * person. This narrows where a person has to look.
 *
 * READ-ONLY.
 *
 *   node scripts/audit-feature-claims.mjs [path-to-features-doc]
 *
 * The path is an argument rather than an environment variable on purpose:
 * `env-parity.test.ts` requires every variable the code reads to be documented
 * in `.env.example`, and listing one there would imply this is application
 * configuration. It is a script parameter. The test was right to catch it.
