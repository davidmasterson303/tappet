/**
 * Live demo verifier — the pre-cutover gate.
 *
 * Checks that a *deployed* build actually serves the public demo. The unit
 * tests in lib/__tests__/demo-availability.test.ts prove the auth machinery
 * lets anonymous visitors through; this proves a real deployment renders.
 *
 * Run it against the candidate site before pointing the domain at it, and
 * against the live site any time you want reassurance:
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-demo.mjs                      # the live demo
 *   node scripts/verify-demo.mjs https://<site>.netlify.app
 *
 * Exits non-zero on failure, so it can gate a deploy step.
 *
 * Read-only. It fetches pages and queries the public REST endpoint with the
 * publishable key — exactly what an anonymous visitor's browser does.
