/**
 * Mobile client contract — the end-to-end check, Phase 2 task 2.5.
 *
 * Everything Phase 2 built is unit-tested in isolation: bearer resolution in
 * `bearer-auth.test.ts`, the CORS policy in `cors.test.ts`, the versioned
 * paths by their own suites. **None of those compose the others.** This
 * project's characteristic failure is not a broken layer, it is every layer
 * green over an end-to-end broken path — `security.test.ts` passed 11 tests
 * against a private reimplementation while the real middleware was a no-op,
 * and the consultant was dead in production while the typecheck, the full
 * suite, verify-demo.mjs *and* the promote gate all said yes.
 *
 * This exercises the whole path in one request sequence, the way a phone will:
 * a cross-origin preflight, then a bearer-authenticated call to a versioned
 * route, then the negative cases that prove the bearer path did not quietly
 * become more permissive than the cookie one.
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-mobile-contract.mjs                       # localhost:3000
 *   node scripts/verify-mobile-contract.mjs https://<site>        # a deployment
 *   node scripts/verify-mobile-contract.mjs --strict              # a partial run exits 1
 *
 * Configuration, all optional, all read from the environment rather than argv
 * so a token never lands in the process table or shell history:
 *
 *   MOBILE_TEST_TOKEN       a real access token from a signed-in session
 *   MOBILE_TEST_VEHICLE_ID  a vehicle that token's owner owns
 *   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS    same var the app reads; first entry is used
 *
 * **Without a token it runs the four anonymous checks and reports the two
 * credentialed ones as NOT RUN.** That is deliberate and it is not a warning
 * to be ignored: the summary states plainly that the run was partial, because
 * a gate that quietly reports success on a subset is exactly how §25's health
 * check degraded a 404 into a shrug.
 *
 * **That paragraph was only true for a reader.** Until `--strict` existed this
 * script exited 0 on a partial run, so anything reading the exit code — CI, a
 * promote gate, a script chain — could not tell a partial from a clean pass.
 * It disclaimed §25's failure in prose and reproduced it in the exit code.
 *
 * Worse, the two states are not symmetric: an *unset* token skips the
 * credentialed checks, while a *set but expired* one fails them — the state
 * this repo has been in since 02:58 UTC on 2 Aug. So the cheapest way to turn
 * this check green was to delete the credential. `--strict` closes that;
 * reasoning in `lib/run-outcome.mjs`, exit rules tested in
 * `run-outcome.test.ts` rather than by running this.
 *
 * Read-only. It never writes.

  ── ⚠ An expired credential is not evidence about the API ──────────────────

  The docblock above already names this state: "an *unset* token skips the
  credentialed checks, while a *set but expired* one fails them — the state
  this repo has been in since 02:58 UTC on 2 Aug". `--strict` fixed the exit
  code. It did not fix what the run *says*.

  Run on 22 Aug against a token that expired on the 2nd, this reported three
  blocking failures, one of them "/api/v1/vehicles rejected a valid bearer
  token — a phone cannot load the garage". Every word of that is wrong except
  the status code. The bearer was not valid, the route was not broken, and the
  phone is fine. A 401 is the *correct* answer to an expired credential.

  ⚠ This is CLAUDE.md §5's second warning rather than its first: not a guard
  that passes while checking nothing, but one that fails loudly and points at
  the wrong thing — on the check that gates a mobile build. The cost is a
  debugging session into a bearer path that works, and the temptation is to
  make it pass by deleting the credential, which §25 and `--strict` exist to
  prevent.

  So an expired token is treated exactly like an absent one: the credentialed
  checks are NOT RUN and say why, with the date. That is not a weakening —
  they genuinely cannot be performed without a usable credential, `--strict`
  still exits 1, and the summary still refuses to call a partial run green.
