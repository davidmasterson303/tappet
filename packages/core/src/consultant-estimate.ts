/**
 * The structured estimate behind the advisor's estimate well.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Board screen 04 is the advisor, and its own summary line is *"Answers are
 * unboxed; **the estimate is a well**; provenance is a claim, never a badge."*
 * The drawn screen carries priced lines:
 *
 * > Fluid flush — $110 – $160
 * > Master cylinder, if needed — $380 – $520
 * > Most likely total — $110 – $160
 *
 * `POST /api/v1/consultant` returned prose and nothing else, so the well could
 * not be built and `Well` sat in the primitive kit with no caller. That is the
 * fourth API gap in `docs/step4-api-gaps.md`, found on 16 Aug after the first
 * three were written up.
 *
 * ── Why the numbers are asked for, not read back out of the prose ───────────
 *
 * Regexing "$110–$160" out of a sentence is the obvious shortcut and it is the
 * wrong one. It cannot tell a price from a part number, an estimate from a
 * figure the owner quoted in their own question, or a total from a line item —
 * and a mis-parsed dollar range rendered as a priced line item is exactly the
 * overclaim the provenance work exists to prevent. This codebase's standing
 * position is that it does not invent precision.
 *
 * So the model emits tags, on the pattern `consultant-commands.ts` already
 * established for wishlist and status write-backs, and this parses them.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Absent must mean absent ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Most advisor answers are not quotes. A well that renders empty — or worse, at
 * $0 — on every non-pricing answer is a worse screen than no well at all, so
 * the estimate is **optional at every level**: no tags means no estimate, and a
 * tag whose numbers do not survive validation is dropped rather than repaired
 * into something plausible.

   * Building it changed both, and the board is the reason: its own example
   * prices two lines at $110–$160 and $380–$520 and then gives "Most likely
   * total" as **$110–$160**. The second line is "Master cylinder, *if needed*",
