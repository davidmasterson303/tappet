/**
 * What a notification says, and where tapping it lands.
 *
 * ── Why this is in core ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `data.url` on a push is a **contract between two codebases**. The server
 * writes it; `apps/mobile`'s `linking` config resolves it. Nothing checks that
 * they agree — a push whose url names a route the navigator does not have opens
 * the app to whatever screen was last on top, which reads as "the notification
 * is broken" and is invisible until someone taps a real one on a real phone.
 *
 * So the url is built here, once, from the same route strings the navigator
 * registers, and `push-notification-links.test.ts` reads both sides. That is
 * the same argument `push-tokens.ts` makes about the token format, applied to
 * the destination instead of the address.
 *
 * ── Why the copy lives here too, rather than at the send site ───────────────
 *
 * Because the copy and the url are one decision. The recall notice says "tap to
 * ask the advisor what it means" and the url carries that question in `?ask=` —
 * `RootStackParamList` records that a link arriving with its question is the
 * reason `ask` exists at all. Split them across two files and the next person
 * changes the sentence without changing the question, and the advisor opens
 * with a composer that asks something the notification did not.
 *
 * ── Deliberately not a template system ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two notification kinds, two functions. A generic
 * `notification(kind, params)` with a lookup table would be shorter and would
 * make the next kind a data change rather than a code change — but it also
 * makes every kind share one shape, and these two already do not: a recall is
 * an event that happened to a model, a service reminder is a threshold this
 * particular car crossed. When there is a third, look again.
 */

 * drive an action. So the destination carries the notice, what it means, what
 * NHTSA says the remedy is, and the fact that the repair is free — and the
 * advisor is reachable from there, per recall, still carrying the question.
 *
