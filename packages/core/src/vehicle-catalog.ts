/**
 * What a car can be called, and how to check that somebody typed one.
 *
 * ── The screen this exists for ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `AddVehicleScreen` asked for a model year, a make and a model through three
 * bare text fields. Four ways that is worse than it looks, and none of them
 * show up in a test:
 *
 *   - **"bmw", "BMW", "Bmw" and "B.M.W." are four different cars** as far as
 *     every downstream join is concerned. Recalls match on year/make/model
 *     strings; so does the dossier prompt. A typo does not fail, it produces a
 *     car nothing can find anything about.
 *   - **A model year is not free text.** "205", "20155" and "2O15" all pass a
 *     four-character check, and the last one is an letter O.
 *   - **Nobody can spell their own trim reliably**, and until now nothing
 *     offered them the spelling.
 *   - It asked a phone owner to type on a phone when the answer was already
 *     printed on the car's own VIN plate.
 *
 * ── Where the data comes from, and what is deliberately not fetched ─────────
 *
 * **Models come from NHTSA vPIC**, live, keyed on make and model year. There is
 * no way to curate that — it is thousands of rows that change every autumn, and
 * a stale copy is worse than none because it looks authoritative.
 *
 * **Makes are the list below, and are *not* fetched.** vPIC will answer
 * `GetMakesForVehicleType/car` with 195 of them and the union with trucks and
 * MPVs is larger still, most of it bodybuilders and trailer manufacturers that
 * no owner will ever pick. A typeahead's job is to make the common case
 * instant, and a list that ships with the app is instant, works on a plane, and
 * is ordered by something better than an API's row order.
 *
 * ⚠ **Neither list is a gate.** Every field this feeds accepts a value that is
 * not in it. A curated list that refused an unlisted make would be this
 * codebase's own rule 10 broken — inventing precision — and would lock out the
 * grey imports, the kit cars and the two-year-old marque the list has not
 * heard of yet.
 *
 * ── No network in here ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module builds URLs and reads responses. It never calls `fetch`, so it
 * runs identically in a Jest process and on a phone, and every case below can
 * be asserted against a fixture rather than against NHTSA's uptime.

 * The VIN inside what a barcode reader handed back, or `null`.

 * The certification label on the driver's door jamb carries the number as a
 * Code 39 (older cars), Code 128 or Data Matrix symbol, and what the reader
 * returns is the label's *data*, which is rarely the bare seventeen
 * characters. Two things get in the way and both are normal:
 *
 *   - **Sentinels.** Code 39 labels wrap the payload in `*`, some readers keep
 *     them, and the AIAG/ANSI data-identifier convention prefixes a VIN with
 *     the letter `I` — a character that is *not in the VIN alphabet*, which is
 *     what makes it a usable separator rather than a trap.
 *   - **Neighbours.** A Data Matrix on a newer label may carry more than the
 *     VIN, and a spoken prefix ("VIN:") shares letters with the alphabet.
 *
 * So the rule is not "strip and take seventeen". It is: upper-case, drop
 * everything outside the alphabet (which drops `I`, `O` and `Q` along with the
 * punctuation), and then look for a seventeen-character window in what is
 * left — **preferring the window whose check digit agrees**, and falling back
 * to a run that is exactly seventeen long. A run longer than seventeen with no
 * agreeing window is ambiguous, and an ambiguous number is not a VIN this
 * product will claim to have read: `null`, and the owner reads the plate.
 *
 * ⚠ Check-digit agreement is used here to *choose*, never to *refuse* — the
 * one exact run is returned whether or not position 9 agrees, for the reason
 * `vinProblem` gives: an import can carry a genuine VIN that fails it.
