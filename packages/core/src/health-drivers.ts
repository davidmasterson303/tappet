/**
 * What the health score is made of — the three drivers.
 *
 * ── Why these are computed and not generated ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * David chose this on 15 Aug against the alternative of asking the model for
 * three more numbers in the health-summary prompt. The alternative was cheaper
 * and it was wrong: **a model asked for a number produces one whether or not it
 * has grounds.** `vehicle_health_summary.maintenance_status` is prose about real
 * data — *"Several intervals coming due. Prioritize CVT fluid and brake fluid"* —
 * and a 73 next to it would be a judgement about nothing.
 *
 * The product's claim is that it shows you *why*. A driver the model invented
 * cannot be explained when the owner taps it, and the health card exists to be
 * tapped. So every input here is a fact the database holds, and every driver
 * carries the sentence that explains its own number.
 *
 * ── ⚠ These do not add up to `health_score`, and must not be shown as if ────
 *
 * `health_score` comes from the model. These three do not, so they explain the
 * *subject* without arithmetically explaining the *total*. That is defensible
 * for one release and awkward forever; whether `health_score` eventually
 * becomes a function of these is a product decision, not a refactor.
 *
 * Until it is taken, a caller must not render "74 = 60 + 90 + 72" or anything
 * that implies it. They are drivers, not terms.
 *
 * ── Null is not zero, and this file says so four times ──────────────────────
 *
 * A missing driver scores `null`, never 0. The same rule the garage card
 * already follows for a missing health score: banding an unmeasured value
 * paints a car red about a condition nobody checked. Every `null` here has a
 * `detail` explaining what is missing, because "—" on its own reads as a bug.

   * The dashboard shows a computed driver and a model-written claim about the
   * same subject, and on the seeded M3 they contradict each other in plain
   * sight: "Maintenance 97 — nothing overdue among the 6 we can check" sits
   * directly above "Brake fluid overdue", and four rounds of a design critique
   * called that the single biggest failure on the page. For a product whose
   * position is that it makes no claim the data cannot support, they were
   * right.
   *
   * ⚠ **Neither side is wrong.** `nextDueMileage` counts a service with no
   * record from the next interval boundary above the odometer — deliberately,
   * because a car bought at 60,000 miles is not 52,500 miles overdue for an
   * oil change — so a 40,000-mile item on a 67,400-mile car with no record is
   * *later*, not overdue. The model reads the same missing record as "likely
   * on original fluid". Two defensible readings of one absence.
   *
   * So the fix is not to silence either. It is to let the screen say they
   * disagree and why, which needs a fact rather than a threshold: this is that
   * fact, set by the driver that computed it. A UI guessing at it from
   * `score >= 80` would be inventing the precision this file exists to refuse.
