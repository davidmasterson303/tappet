/**
 * What an NHTSA recall lookup actually concluded.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The defect this exists to make impossible (FN-03, 24 Aug) ─────────────
 *
 * `recallsByVehicle` matches on NHTSA's own controlled vocabulary. A make or
 * model it does not recognise returns **HTTP 200 with `{"Count": 0, "results":
 * []}`** — byte-identical to a genuinely clean vehicle.
 *
 * Both were stored as `recalls: []`, and the screen then derived "we checked"
 * from the row existing. So typing **"Chevy"** instead of **"CHEVROLET"** gave
 * a 2014 Silverado a green tick and the words *"No active recalls"* while its
 * real open campaigns were never raised. Same for "Dodge Ram", any accented
 * marque, and any model containing a slash. The vehicle strings are
 * user-supplied and were never validated.
 *
 * This is `health-claims.ts`'s Takata defect one table over: **absence rendered
 * as an all-clear, on a safety claim.** The difference is that here the absence
 * is indistinguishable after the fact — `[]` is the same bytes either way — so
 * the outcome has to be recorded by the code that made the call, at the moment
 * it is known.
 *
 * ── Why the vocabulary check is a second request and worth it ───────────────
 *
 * `GetModelsForMakeYear` is NHTSA's own list of models for a make and year. If
 * it returns nothing, the make is not one NHTSA knows and a zero-recall answer
 * for it means nothing. One extra request per *research run* — not per page
 * view — against a free API, to avoid telling somebody their truck is clear.

/**
 * Whether this vehicle's recall picture may be treated as known.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Why the status alone is not enough, found by querying production ──────
 *
 * `nhtsa_data.lookup_status` **does not exist in the live database** — the
 * migration that adds it has not been applied, and PostgREST answers `42703`
 * for it. Every read therefore resolves to `undefined`, `recallsWereChecked`
 * answers `false` for every vehicle, and the dashboard's recalls driver says
 * *"Recalls have not been checked for this vehicle"* about cars whose
 * `nhtsa_data` row is sitting there holding two recall campaigns.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic disagreement. The same screen renders the model's
 * written status beside it — `healthClaim` deliberately lets a written finding
 * win, because suppressing a real one is the dangerous direction — so a reader
 * met "have not been checked" directly above "2 open recalls — fuel pump and
 * electrical system". A design critique of the rendered page called it fatal
 * for a product whose position is that it makes no claim the data cannot
 * support, and it was right.
 *
 * ── The asymmetry is the whole idea, and it is safe in one direction only ───
 *
 * Recall **rows are evidence in themselves**: something matched this vehicle
 * to produce them. An **empty** array is not, and that is the case §10 and the
 * `lookup_status` migration exist for — an `nhtsa_data` row is written even
 * for a lookup NHTSA did not recognise, so a bare `[]` is indistinguishable
 * from a genuinely clean truck.
 *
 * So: a non-empty array proves the check happened; an empty one proves nothing
 * without the status. This never converts an unknown into an all-clear, which
 * is the only direction that would be dangerous — it converts an unknown into
 * a known *finding*.
 *
 * ⚠ This does not make the migration unnecessary. Without it, a vehicle NHTSA
 * genuinely cleared still reads as unchecked, which is a real (if honest) loss
 * of information. Apply it and this function keeps working unchanged.
