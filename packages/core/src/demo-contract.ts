/**
 * What the public demo requires in order to work.
 *
 * The demo at tappet-demo.davidmasterson.co is linked from David's
 * portfolio and is being shown to recruiters. It must keep working while the
 * authenticated product is built around it. Treat any change that breaks this
 * contract as a release blocker, not a regression to fix later.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The demo and the product pull in opposite directions. Everything Phase 0
 * and 1 added — route middleware, session-gated server actions, RLS keyed to
 * ownership — assumes an authenticated user. The demo has none, and survives
 * on explicit carve-outs scattered across the codebase.
 *
 * That already failed once: the middleware added in task 0.9 protected
 * /dashboard wholesale and bounced anonymous visitors from the demo to
 * /login. It was caught by loading the page in a browser, not by any test.
 *
 * So the requirements live here, in one place, and are checked twice:
 *
 *   lib/__tests__/demo-availability.test.ts   static — runs in CI
 *   scripts/verify-demo.mjs                   live  — run before any cutover
 *
 * Both import this file. Adding a requirement in one place tightens both.
