/**
 * What it takes to mark a wishlist item done, and what the record will say.
 *
 * Pure — no clock of its own, no network. The caller supplies `today`.
 *
 * ── Why this is not just a form ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Completing an item is the only action in the wishlist that **writes into the
 * car's permanent history**: `POST /api/v1/wishlist/complete` inserts a
 * `maintenance_line_items` row and deletes the wishlist entry. There is no undo
 * and the row is what the advisor, the health score and the service schedule
 * all read afterwards.
 *
 * That route is forgiving about what it is given — a missing shop becomes
 * `'Unknown'`, missing costs become `0`, a missing date becomes today. Forgiving
 * is right for a route and wrong for a form: submitted empty, it writes a row
 * that *looks* like a maintenance record and carries no information. This
 * project already has a name for that shape — a UI implying data it does not
 * have — and `enrichVehicle`'s docblock calls it "the §21 provenance problem in
 * a new costume."
 *
 * So the rule below asks for the one fact that makes the row worth having, and
 * refuses to invent the rest.

 *
 * Cost is genuinely often unknown at the moment a job finishes — the invoice
 * arrives later, or the parts were bought over three weeks. Requiring it would
 * push people to type a number they are guessing at, and a guessed cost in
 * permanent history is worse than an absent one, because nothing downstream can
 * tell them apart.

 * is the field that makes the row legible a year later. Without it the record
 * reads "Unknown", which is the route's default and tells the reader nothing
 * about whether it happened at all.
