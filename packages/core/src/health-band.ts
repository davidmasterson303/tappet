/**
 * Health-score banding — the judgement, without the styling.
 *
 * ── Why this is in core ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `hooks/use-health-band.ts` already existed to stop two web components banding
 * a score differently on the same screen. Its own note is the rule: the short
 * form is "an **abbreviation, never a different judgement**".
 *
 * Phase 3.2 puts a third renderer on the same number — the Expo garage — and it
 * cannot import that hook. Not because of `'use client'`, but because every
 * presentational field in it is web-only: `color` is a `var(--ring-good)`
 * reference resolved by globals.css, and `textClass` is a Tailwind class that
 * only exists if Tailwind saw the literal. React Native has neither a CSS custom
 * property nor a Tailwind build.
 *
 * Copying the thresholds into the mobile app is how the two-components bug
 * comes back at two-clients scale, and it would be worse there: the drift would
 * be invisible until someone compared a phone with a laptop side by side.
 *
 * So the split is by *nature*, not by convenience. What a score **means** —
 * where the boundaries fall, what to call it — is product judgement and lives
 * here. How that reads on a given platform is presentation and stays with the
 * platform. `rgb` sits on this side because bare `r,g,b` channels are a colour
 * value rather than a styling mechanism; both clients build their own
 * expression from them (`rgba()` on web, a hex or object on RN).
 *
 * ── Changing a threshold ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Change it here and every client moves together. That is the point, and it is
 * also the hazard: there is no longer a way to adjust the web ramp alone. If a
 * platform ever genuinely needs a different boundary, that is a product
 * decision and belongs in the roadmap, not in a local constant.

    ⚠ **These four move with `--ring-*` in `app/globals.css` or not at all.**

    That instruction was already here, written when `ok` came off cyan on
    3 Sep, and it is the reason this edit exists: the CSS tokens draw the ring
    *stroke*, and these channels draw its glow and every React Native surface.
    Moving one and not the other does not break — it half-applies, which is the
    failure mode `CLAUDE.md` §6 is entirely about. A ring whose arc is sodium
    and whose halo is still green reads as a rendering artefact, and on the
    phone nothing would have moved at all.

    The ramp left green on 4 Sep for the locked design brief's two-hue rule,
    and climbs sodium intensity instead: off-white → warm stone → sodium → hot
    sodium. Still four steps orderable without a legend, now ordered by heat
    rather than by hue. `app/globals.css` at `--ring-good` carries the full
    argument, including why a healthy car is better rendered as unremarkable
    than as green.

    The labels are untouched. They were tuned separately and this is a change
    of colour, not of judgement.
