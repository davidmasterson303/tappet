/**
 * The garage card's third row — *"Next service · Oil & filter · in 420 mi"*.
 *
 * ── The thing this file exists to get right ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `docs/step4-api-gaps.md` §3 blocked the whole row on one sentence: *"'No
 * schedule yet' is not the same as 'nothing due', and the card must not imply
 * the second."* `nextService`'s own docblock says the same. That is the
 * decision, and everything below follows from it.
 *
 * ⚠ **It is decided here rather than at the shop counter of a component**
 * because it is a claim about a car, not a layout. The same rule holds
 * wherever this line is drawn.
 *
 * ── What actually disambiguates the empty state, and it is not the copy ─────
 *
 * The obvious worry is that "No schedule yet" sitting alone on a card reads as
 * "this car has nothing coming up" — reassurance the product has not earned.
 * The fix is not a cleverer phrase. **It is that the label never leaves.** The
 * row is always *"Next service — <something>"*, so the subject of the sentence
 * is fixed before the value is read, and "No schedule yet" can only be heard as
 * an answer to *that* question: we do not have a schedule. A row that vanishes
 * when the answer is unknown is the version that lies, because a card with no
 * next-service line, next to one that has it, reads as a car with nothing due.
 *
 * This is also why the phrasing matches `GarageBay`'s sibling **"No score
 * yet"** rather than inventing a new form of words. Two absences on one card
 * that phrase themselves differently read as two different kinds of problem.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Timing is required, and a named service without it is worse than none ──
 *
 * If a label survives but nothing says *when*, this returns `unknown` rather
 * than a bare service name. "Oil & filter" alone under a heading that says
 * "Next service" reads as *now*, which is the loudest thing this row can say
 * and the one it would be saying by accident.

 *
 * ── Why staleness is not a case here, though the migration warns about it ───
 *
 * `next_service_at_miles` is an **absolute odometer reading**, not a distance,
 * so "in 420 mi" is recomputed against live mileage on every read. A sweep
 * that ran three days ago is still right about the reading the service falls
 * due at, and the countdown corrects itself as the car is driven. That is a
 * quiet virtue of storing the answer as a position rather than a remainder,
 * and it is worth stating because a remainder would have needed a fourth
 * column and a freshness rule.
 *
 * The staleness the migration does accept is different and real: a service
 * completed since the last sweep still shows as due. Vehicle detail computes
 * live from the schedule, and this row is a glance.
