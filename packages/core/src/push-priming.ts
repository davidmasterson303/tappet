/**
 * Whether to explain notifications before iOS asks about them.
 *
 * Phase 5, C5. Pure — no clock of its own, no storage, no React Native — so the
 * rule can be tested without a device, which matters because the behaviour it
 * governs is **irreversible and can only be observed once per install.**
 *
 * ── The problem, stated once ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * iOS shows the notification permission dialog **exactly once**. A "no" is only
 * undoable in Settings, which nobody goes to. Today `registerForPush()` fires
 * on entry to the signed-in stack, so the one irreversible ask is spent
 * immediately, on somebody who has just signed in and has not yet seen what the
 * product does. The most likely answer to a dialog you did not expect is no.
 *
 * `push.ts`'s own docblock has said this since it was written: *"the better
 * pattern is a screen explaining what Well Kept would tell them before the
 * system dialog appears… That screen is worth building before submission and is
 * not built."* This is the rule half of building it.
 *
 * ── Why a primer is not just politeness ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A primer is refusable without cost. Someone who says "not now" to *our*
 * screen has spent nothing — the system ask is still available, and we can ask
 * again next month when they have a car and a service coming due. Someone who
 * says no to *Apple's* dialog has spent it permanently.
 *
 * So the primer is not a second prompt bolted onto the first. It is the thing
 * that makes the first prompt recoverable.

 * 5.5 exists for.

 *
 * Written to the house voice per `cc-marketing-0001`: plain and direct, no
 * cocky or cheeky lines. It states what arrives and how often, because the
 * honest objection to notifications is "how much will this bother me" and a
 * primer that does not answer it is decoration.
