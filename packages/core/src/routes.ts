 * a session dies underneath a page the user is already sitting on. A client
 * component cannot import `middleware.ts` — that module pulls in `next/server`.

    A signed-in user does not get the demo garage. See DEMO_GARAGE_ROUTE.

    **This rule is enforced on the client, not by middleware**, and that is a
    cost decision rather than an oversight. `/` is deliberately absent from the
    middleware matcher — the config records why, at length: matching it would put
    a `getUser()` network round trip in front of every anonymous load of the most
    visited page on the site, which is the recruiter-facing demo. Paying that on
    every visit to slightly tidy the experience of the one signed-in user is the
    wrong trade.

    `components/AuthProvider.tsx` applies it, and it is written here so the policy
    has one definition and can be tested without a browser. If `/` is ever added
    to the matcher this starts working there too, with no change.
