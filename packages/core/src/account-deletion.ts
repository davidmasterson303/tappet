 *
 * App Store guideline 5.1.1(v) requires deletion to be initiated **from inside
 * the reviewed app**, so the mobile flow is not a convenience — it is the one
 * Apple looks at. The web flow already existed. Two implementations of "has the
 * user confirmed" means the surface being reviewed can quietly become the
 * weaker of the two, and nothing would report it: both would still delete
 * accounts, and both would still look right.
 *
 * So the phrase, the comparison and the summary live here, and each surface
 * owns only its own presentation.

/**
 * What the user types to arm the delete button.

 * and the software keyboard readily appends a trailing space, so a strict

 * exactly what was asked — which reads as a broken screen, not as a safeguard.
 * The friction that matters is having to type the word at all.

/**
 * What a subscriber has to be told before deleting, and why it is a warning
 * rather than a block.
 *
 * Phase 6, E5. **Deleting an account while an Apple-billed subscription keeps
 * charging is a documented App Store rejection reason**, and it is a real
 * failure rather than a paperwork one: the account that could manage the
 * subscription is gone, so the charge continues and the person has no obvious
 * way to stop it.
 *
 * ── Why we cannot just cancel it ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * We do not hold the billing relationship. Apple does. There is no server-side
 * call that cancels an App Store subscription on a user's behalf — only the
 * account holder can, through the App Store. Any copy implying otherwise would
 * be a promise the product cannot keep, which is worse than the silence it
 * replaces.
 *
 * ── Why it must not block deletion ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The tempting fix is to refuse deletion until the subscription is cancelled.
 * **That trades one guideline violation for a worse one.** 5.1.1(v) requires
 * that deletion be initiated and completed from inside the app; gating it on an
 * action that happens in a *different* app is exactly the obstruction the
 * guideline exists to prevent, and it is the more likely rejection of the two.
 *
 * So: say it plainly, say it before the confirmation, and let them proceed.
