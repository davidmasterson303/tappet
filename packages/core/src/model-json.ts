/**
 * Reading a value out of a model's JSON, in whichever spelling it arrived in.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The defect this exists to end ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **Every health score Well Kept ever generated was 70.** The prompt asked for
 * `healthScore`; the parser read `health_score`; the value was therefore always
 * `undefined`, and the line under it substituted a documented neutral. Nothing
 * failed. The number was written to the column a gauge reads, and the gauge
 * rendered it beside a summary saying the car's condition was *"impossible to
 * assess"* — two halves of one row, one of them a constant.
 *
 * It survived because **a missing key and a key holding the wrong type look the
 * same to `??`**, and because the fallback was defensible in isolation: 70 *is*
 * the right value when generation failed. What made it a lie was that
 * generation had succeeded.
 *
 * ── Why "first of these" rather than "normalise the object" ─────────────────
 *
 * A `camelCase → snake_case` transform over the whole payload is the tempting
 * fix and it is worse. It would silently absorb a **renamed** prompt field — ask
 * for `overallScore` tomorrow and a whole-object transform still produces a
 * `health_score` key holding `undefined`, and the same bug returns wearing a
 * different name.
 *
 * Naming both spellings at the call site is deliberately more typing. It puts
 * the prompt's word and the column's word on one line, where a rename to either
 * is visible to whoever makes it — and it is what
 * `lib/__tests__/health-prompt-fields-are-read.test.ts` can check mechanically.
 *
 * ── Every reader returns `null`, never a default ────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ The caller decides what absence means, because only the caller knows
 * whether absence is safe. `red_flags` may default to `[]`; a score may not
 * default to anything. §6 of `CLAUDE.md`: `null` is never `0`, and a missing
 * score is "we cannot say".
