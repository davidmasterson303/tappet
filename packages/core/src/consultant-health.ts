/**
 * Classifying a consultant round trip into good / broken / degraded.
 *
 * Pure. The route in `app/api/health/consultant` does the network call and
 * hands the result here, so the decision that gates a promotion can be tested
 * without Google, without a key, and without a deployment.
 *
 * ── Why three outcomes and not two ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * From `CREWCHIEF_ROUNDTRIP_GATE_DESIGN.md`. A gate that fails on someone
 * else's outage gets routed around within a week, and a gate people route
 * around is worse than no gate. So "the consultant is broken" and "Gemini is
 * unavailable right now" are different answers with different consequences:
 * the first is ours and blocks absolutely; the second blocks but can be
 * overridden deliberately, on the command line, with the reason written into
 * the promotion's merge commit.
 *
 * ── Why classification happens server-side ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The route sees the actual Google error object. `verify-demo.mjs` would only
 * see text through two layers of indirection, and a classifier built on
 * someone else's copywriting is a classifier that breaks when they reword an
 * error. The route returns a machine token; the script reads the token.
 *
 * That matters here more than usual: §22 records this project mis-diagnosing a
 * 401 twice, because a stale credential and a malformed one return **the same
 * UNAUTHENTICATED text**. Both are `broken` below, which is why that
 * distinction does not need to be made to gate correctly.
