/**
 * The one service question a new owner is asked, and what it turns into.
 *
 * Track A2a. Rev F's constraint is the whole design brief: *"**One** question —
 * most recent visit, mileage and roughly when — plus a 'skip, I'll scan my
 * receipts' path. Not a twelve-category matrix; every onboarding question costs
 * completion on the first screen a paying user meets."*
 *
 * ── Why it asks about the oil change specifically ───────────────────────────
 *
 * "When was it last serviced?" is the natural phrasing and it does not work,
 * for a mechanical reason rather than a stylistic one: the answer has to be
 * matched to a scheduled service, `categoryFor('service')` is `null`, and a
 * baseline that matches nothing is a question asked for no benefit.
 *
 * So the question names the work. **Oil change** is the right one to name on
 * three counts, and they happen to agree:
 *
 *   - It is the service people actually remember. "Last oil change" gets an
 *     answer; "last service" gets "erm, the dealer did something".
 *   - It has the shortest interval in almost every schedule, so it is the item
 *     most likely to be due and the one where a wrong baseline costs most.
 *   - It maps cleanly and unambiguously onto `Oil Change`.
 *
 * The other services stay estimated, and the receipts path is how they stop
 * being. That is a smaller claim than "we know your history" and it is the true
 * one.
 *
 * ── Erring toward due, never toward fine ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Roughly when" cannot produce a date, so each option resolves to **the oldest
 * date in its range**. Someone choosing "in the last 6 months" is recorded as
 * six months ago, not three.
 *
 * The asymmetry is deliberate and it is a safety judgement rather than a
 * statistical one. Reporting a service as *more recently done than it was*
 * suppresses a real alert — the app quietly tells someone their brakes are fine
 * — and reporting it as *older than it was* raises one slightly early, which
 * costs an unnecessary glance. Those two errors are not equal, so the estimate
 * is not centred.

 *
 * ── 20 Sep · "Just done", and why it is a month rather than today ───────────
 *
 * The phone's rebuilt first run asks this as one chip row with no keyboard,
 * and the answer most owners of a car that just left the shop want to give
 * was not on the list: "In the last 6 months" resolved to six months ago, so
 * an oil change done on Tuesday put the next one due at once. "Just done" is
 * that answer. It resolves to **one month**, not to today, under the same
 * rule as every other option — the oldest point in the range, because "just"
 * means "recently" and recording it as this morning would be the one place
 * this module rounded toward "fine".
 *
 * The 6-to-12 band stays. It is the band an oil change is most likely to be
 * *due* in, and a row that dropped it would make its owners choose between a
 * wrong answer and "not sure" — the exact guess the last paragraph is
 * written against.
