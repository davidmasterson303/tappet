/**
 * What the subscription buys — three features, not a bigger number.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The pricing decision of 24 Aug, and what it replaces ──────────────────
 *
 * The paid tier used to be **a larger token allowance**: 400,000
 * output-equivalent tokens a month became 1,000,000, and `PaywallScreen` sold
 * that difference in as many words. The boundary moves from *how much you have
 * used* to *which features you have*.
 *
 * Three things go wrong with selling an allowance, and they compound:
 *
 *   1. **Nobody can tell what they are buying.** "A monthly allowance for
 *      Well Kept's AI features" is a unit the customer has never seen, cannot
 *      observe while using the app, and has no way to relate to their own use.
 *   2. **The number invites a claim, and the claim was wrong.** The screen said
 *      the paid tier *"raises that allowance five times over"*; 400k → 1M is
 *      **2.5×**. IAP-06. Deriving the figure from `TIERS` fixed the arithmetic
 *      and left the unit unintelligible.
 *   3. **It prices the wrong thing.** Both tiers could reach every feature, so
 *      the expensive paths — the advisor, invoice vision, dossier research —
 *      were open to free accounts and bounded only by a fuse. Cost and revenue
 *      were not connected to each other at any point.
 *
 * A feature gate answers all three. It is nameable on a paywall, it is
 * observable in the product, and the three paid features are exactly the three
 * that call a model — so price now tracks cost by construction rather than by
 * a ceiling somebody tunes.
 *
 * ── ⚠ IAP-06 is killed rather than corrected ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `entitlementMultiple()` in `ai/budget.ts` exists solely to keep that "five
 * times" copy honest. With the allowance out of the sales pitch there is **no
 * multiple to state**, so the sentence is deleted rather than fixed. A derived
 * figure that nothing renders is a smaller version of the same problem.
 *
 * ── The ceiling survives, as a fuse and not as a pitch ──────────────────────
 *
 * `TIERS` and `decideBudget` are unchanged and still enforced. What changes is
 * that the ceiling is **abuse protection behind the gate**, never customer-
 * facing copy: it exists so one runaway account cannot cost more than every
 * subscription it sits beside, and an ordinary month does not approach it.
 * `ai/budget.ts` already calls it "a fuse, not a meter" — this is that sentence
 * taken seriously in the product as well as the code.

/**
 * The three features a subscription unlocks.
 *
 * ⚠ These are exactly the three that call a model. That is not a coincidence to
 * be maintained by hand — it is the reason the gate is drawn here, and a fourth
 * paid feature that costs nothing to run would be a price rise wearing a
 * feature's clothes.

/**
 * What an account keeps without paying, and it is deliberately a real product.
 *
 * ── ⚠ These are the *readable* features, not a free tier ────────────────────
 *
 * There is no free tier as of 30 Aug. What this list is now is what a **lapsed**
 * account keeps: a garage that stops working when a subscription ends is a
 * hostage, and the records in it are the owner's own. Everything here is
 * something Well Kept stored rather than generated, so none of it costs
 * anything to keep showing somebody.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Recalls moved to paid on 30 Aug, and the argument against is kept ─────
 *
 * This list held `recalls` and this docblock argued hard that it must: they are
 * safety notices from a federal database, and a defect notice an owner cannot
 * see because their card expired is not a version of this product that should
 * exist. Design's rebrand package first gated them, then reversed and endorsed
 * that argument.
 *
 * **David overruled both.** It is his call and it is made; the argument is kept
 * here rather than deleted because the next person to read this file will have
 * the same instinct, and they should be able to see it was considered rather
 * than missed.
 *
 * ⚠ What it costs, stated plainly so nobody has to rediscover it: an owner
 * whose subscription has ended stops receiving new recall notifications for a
 * car they still own. `RECALL_ALERTS_AFTER_LAPSE` in `access.ts` is the switch,
 * and it is `false` for the same reason — David, 30 Aug: no features that incur
 * costs for a lapsed account. What a lapsed owner keeps is every recall already
 * stored against their vehicles, which stays readable like the rest of the
 * record.

/**
 * Whether this account may use a paid feature.
 *
 * ── ⚠ `enforced` exists because you cannot gate what nobody can buy ─────────
 *
 * It is not a feature flag in the usual sense — a knob for rolling something
 * out gradually — and it must not become one. It encodes a single rule:
 *
 *   **A feature may only be gated behind a purchase the app can actually make.**
 *
 * At the time this was written, `PaywallScreen` is mounted by no navigator and
 * no StoreKit library is installed: E8 is unfinished, and there is literally
 * nothing to buy. Shipping an enforcing gate in that state would take the
 * advisor, invoice scanning and the dossier away from every existing account
 * and offer them no way back — a worse product for everybody, and on the
 * surface App Review opens.
 *
 * So the decision is implemented in full and enforcement is off until the thing
 * it points at exists. This is the same shape as
 * `readFailureMeansNoSubscription`'s deploy-ordering rule: a sequencing hazard
 * expressed as a rule in the code rather than as a step in a runbook, because a
 * runbook step is only as good as the person reading it at the moment they push.
 *
 * ⚠ Turning it on is a **product launch**, not a config change. Its
 * preconditions are E8 complete: a purchasable product in App Store Connect, the
 * paywall reachable, and a tested Restore. `paid-features.test.ts` asserts the
 * default is off precisely so nobody flips it by accident and discovers the
 * order was wrong from a support email.
