/**
 * Is this schedule entry usable for deciding a service is due?
 *
 * The one question that matters, asked in one place. A "yes" means the entry
 * carries **either** a mileage number that can be compared against an odometer
 * **or** a month interval that can be compared against a date.
 *
 * ── This required miles until 7 Aug 2026, and that was a half-fix ───────────
 *
 * `c09ccf8` taught `service-due.ts` — the *read* side — that a service can be
 * time-based, because all four cars in the product carry a time-only brake
 * fluid entry and every one of them was being dropped. **The write side never
 * moved.** So the read side could evaluate a time-only entry and the schema
 * that guards onboarding would never let one be stored, and because the array
 * is filtered by `preprocess` rather than validated, it failed **silently** —
 * no error, no warning, the entry simply gone.
 *
 * It is the same disappearance `c09ccf8` was written to stop, one layer up, and
 * it survived because the fix was applied where the symptom was seen rather
 * than at both ends of the contract. Found by Cowork on 7 Aug, building the
 * backfill against a handoff of mine that asserted this already worked. It did
 * not; I had not checked.
 *
 * **Legacy prose rows still answer "no", and that is still the point.** Every
 * vehicle onboarded before 7 Aug holds `{item, interval: "every 30,000 miles"}`.
 * Parsing that back into a number is deliberately not done here: the formats are
 * open-ended ("annually", "every 2 years or 24k"), a parser would be right most
 * of the time, and *most of the time* is the wrong standard for a notification
 * that tells someone their car needs work.
 *
 * ── Both intervals are checked for finiteness, and months was not ───────────
 *
 * `Number.isFinite` was applied to miles and nothing at all to months, and
 * zod's `.positive()` accepts `Infinity`. Harmless while nothing read the
 * field; `c09ccf8` made it load-bearing. The read side happens to guard
 * (`service-due.ts`'s own `positive()` checks finiteness), so the effect was
 * not a service reading as "fine forever" — it was the entry vanishing from
 * evaluation entirely, which is the failure this whole function exists to stop.

    ── "Absent" and "malformed" are different, and conflating them costs ──────

    `0`, `null` and `undefined` all mean *this axis does not apply* — the
    prompt's own instruction is "use 0 for numbers" when there is no data, so a
    time-only service routinely arrives carrying `interval_miles: 0`. Those are
    cleared to `null` by `sanitiseScheduleEntry` and the entry survives on its
    other axis.

    A string, a negative, a `NaN` or an `Infinity` is a *malformed* value, not
    an absent one, and the entry is dropped whole. Cowork's point, and it is
    right: nulling `interval_miles: "7500"` would silently reinterpret a
    7,500-mile service as a purely time-based one, which is a worse outcome than
    losing the entry — the schedule would then quietly tell someone the wrong
    thing rather than tell them nothing.

 * ── The regression this closes ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `isUsableScheduleEntry` asks whether an entry has **at least one** usable
 * interval. Once it started accepting either, `{interval_miles: 0,
 * interval_months: 12}` began passing the filter on its months and then
 * **throwing** on its miles, because the field schema is `.positive()`.
 *
 * That created a third outcome where there had only ever been two. The whole
 * design of this preprocess is that a bad entry costs *one entry* — `parse`
 * throws on the entire object, so a schedule with one junk interval took the
 * complete knowledge base with it and left a new user staring at a broken first
 * screen. And `interval_miles: 0` is not exotic: the prompt's own "0 for
 * numbers" fallback produces exactly it.
 *
 * Filtering decides **whether** an entry survives; this decides **what shape**
 * it survives in, so validation only ever sees values it can accept. Anything
 * non-positive or non-finite becomes `null`, which is the honest reading — the
 * entry is time-based, or mileage-based, and the other axis is simply unknown.
 *
 * Found by Cowork on 7 Aug, comparing the backfill's mirror against the real
 * schema. My own tests missed it because they checked `{miles: 0}` alone, which
 * the filter drops, and `{miles: 0, months: 12}` through `isUsableScheduleEntry`
 * but never through `parse`.

    Structured, and that is a recent and deliberate change.

    This used to be `{item, interval: string, priority}` — an interval like
    "every 30,000 miles" as prose. `MaintenanceScheduleItem` in `types.ts` has
    declared the structured shape the whole time and **nothing produced it**;
    `app/actions.ts` reconciled the two with `item.item || item.service`. A type
    that describes a contract nothing satisfies is the same failure as
    `build_assets.py` being referenced everywhere and never committed.

    It is structured now because a service-due notification has to compare an
    interval against an odometer reading, and prose cannot be compared to
    anything. `performance_stats` in the same prompt already forces numerics out
    of the model for the same reason — this finishes that pattern rather than
    inventing one.

    `interval_miles` is `positive()` rather than `nonnegative()` on purpose. The
    prompt's own "0 for numbers" fallback would otherwise produce a service due
    at zero miles — that is, overdue on every car, forever. A model that does
    not know an interval must omit the entry, and the schema is what holds it
    to that.

    ── Why the entries are filtered before validation, not validated ──────────

    Because this schema guards **onboarding**, and `parse` throws on the whole
    object. One hallucinated interval in a list of twelve would otherwise fail
    the entire knowledge base and leave a new user staring at a broken first
    screen — the strictness would cost more than the bad row it caught.

    Dropping the entry instead degrades in the right direction: the car gets a
    schedule with eleven services on it, and the twelfth is absent rather than
    wrong. Absent is recoverable and visible; wrong is neither.

    ── Either interval, not both ──────────────────────────────────────────────

    `interval_miles` is nullable because **a brake fluid flush has no mileage
    interval**, on any of the four cars in this product. Requiring one was a
    half-fix: the read side learned about time on 7 Aug and this did not, so a
    time-only entry could be evaluated but never stored. `isUsableScheduleEntry`
    holds the "at least one real interval" rule; these types describe the shape
    of whatever survives it.

    `.finite()` on both, because `.positive()` accepts `Infinity` — which is a
    number, passes every check written here before today, and describes a
    service that is never due.
