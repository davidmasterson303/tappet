/**
 * Storage paths for the `vehicle-documents` bucket.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four upload paths each invented their own convention:
 *
 *   uploadInvoice               {vehicleId}/{file}
 *   uploadVehiclePhoto          vehicle-photos/{vehicleId}/{file}
 *   uploadConsultantDocument    consultant-docs/{vehicleId}/{sessionId}/{file}
 *   uploadInvoiceForCompletion  invoices/{file}          <- no vehicle at all
 *
 * That broke three things simultaneously:
 *
 *   - The storage RLS policy keys on `(storage.foldername(name))[1]::uuid`.
 *     'vehicle-photos', 'consultant-docs' and 'invoices' cannot cast to a
 *     uuid, so the policy could not protect those objects at all.
 *   - Signed-URL minting derives the vehicle from the first path segment, so
 *     it only worked for the first convention.
 *   - Account deletion had to special-case each shape, and still cannot purge
 *     the fourth, because those objects carry no owner.
 *
 * ── The rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The first path segment is always a vehicle id.** Everything else is
 * organisation below that. This makes ownership derivable from the path
 * alone, which is what both the RLS policy and the deletion sweep rely on.
 *
 * Never build one of these paths by hand.

/**
 * ── What goes in the database ───────────────────────────────────────────────

 * Not a URL. The bucket is private (migration 20260726180000), so the two URL
 * shapes available are both unstorable:
 *
 *   - `/object/public/vehicle-documents/…` never resolves against a private
 *     bucket. It returns `400 {"statusCode":"404","error":"Bucket not found"}`

 *   - A signed URL resolves, and then expires. Persisting one moves the
 *     breakage an hour into the future rather than fixing it.
 *
 * So the *path* is persisted, and a signed URL is minted per read. The stored
 * value is prefixed so a column holding a path is distinguishable from one
 * holding a real URL, both by code and by eye:
 *
 *   placeholder://{vehicleId}/{kind}/{file}
 *
 * The scheme is spelled `placeholder://` because existing rows and
 * `scripts/purge-orphaned-objects.mjs` already use that literal. It reads like
 * a stand-in, which is unfortunate — but renaming it means migrating both, and
