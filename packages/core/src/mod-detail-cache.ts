/**
 * The identity of a modification analysis, so two owners of the same car pay
 * for it once.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `modification_details` was **89% of all AI spend** in the first three weeks
 * of metering — 232 of 292 calls — and it had no cache at any level. Every
 * time anyone opened a mod, the same analysis was generated from scratch.
 *
 * It is the most cacheable call in the product and was the only uncached one.
 * Its prompt reads exactly five values, and **not one of them identifies a
 * person or a specific car**: year, make, model, the modification's name and
 * the owner's performance goal (a three-value choice). No VIN, no mileage, no
 * service history, no user id, no free text the owner wrote. "Cold air intake
 * on a 2018 Accord, moderate goal" has one answer, and it is the same answer
 * for everybody.
 *
 * ⚠ Audit 360, LEGAL-14 (1 Oct): the owner's free-text ownership objective
 * was the sixth value until today. It went to Google from a path with no
 * consent sheet, and it sat verbatim in this shared key — a column no
 * account deletion reaches. It also made the key nearly unique per owner:
 * production's 11 rows all carried one, with `hit_count` 0 on every one, so
 * the cache had never served a single hit. Dropping it fixes both.
 *
 * ⚠ **The existing `performance_mod_cache` does not solve this.** It caches the
 * mod *list*, and it is keyed on `vehicle_id` — so two people with identical
 * cars share nothing, and the details are not cached at all.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The failure mode this key has to avoid ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A cache key narrower than the prompt serves one car's answer for another's.
 * That failure is **silent and confident**: the reader gets a fluent, specific
 * analysis of the wrong vehicle, and nothing anywhere reports an error.
 *
 * So the rule is mechanical: **every value interpolated into the prompt is in
 * the key, and the key contains nothing else.** `mod-detail-cache.test.ts`
 * pins the field list against the prompt, so adding an input without adding it
 * here fails the build rather than poisoning the cache.
 *
 * If a future prompt reads mileage, or the car's known issues, those become
 * part of the identity — or the cache has to go. There is no third option
 * where the prompt is personalised and the answer is shared.
