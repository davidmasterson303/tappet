/**
 * What the app has to say before a person's data reaches a third-party AI.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Guideline 5.1.2(i), amended November 2025 (LEG-02) ────────────────────
 *
 * Apple now requires **explicit permission** before personal data is shared
 * with a third-party AI — not disclosure, permission. Well Kept has the
 * disclosure: the privacy policy names Google and says what goes there. The
 * only *consent* was sign-up wrap, which is not what the amendment asks for.
 *
 * ── Why the copy lives in `core` ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because it has to be identical on both clients, and because this codebase's
 * most repeated defect is a capability that lives in one client and is silently
 * absent from the other. A consent sheet whose wording differs between the web
 * upload dialog and `InvoiceScanScreen` is two different consents, and only one
 * of them is the one somebody actually gave.
 *
 * ── ⚠ It names Google, and it names what leaves ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Third-party AI services" is the phrasing that satisfies nobody. The
 * amendment is about a person being able to decide, and deciding needs to know
 * **who** and **what** — so the copy says Google, and says the invoice carries
 * a shop's name and address as well as the owner's own car.
 *
 * That last part is the one somebody would not think of: an invoice is not only
 * their data. `LEG-09` is the same fact from the retention side.
