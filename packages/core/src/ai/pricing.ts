/**
 * What a subscription earns, what a customer can cost, and the rule that keeps
 * the second below the first.
 *
 * ── The requirement, in David's words ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"Some combo of pricing and LLM call budget that will prevent me from losing
 * money on any users. I want the price low, though — designing a model where
 * worst case customer usage is breakeven is ok with me."*
 *
 * That is a stronger constraint than it sounds, and it decides the shape of
 * this file. **Breakeven at the ceiling** means the ceiling cannot be chosen
 * for how generous it feels — it is whatever number makes the worst possible
 * month cost exactly what the worst-paying plan earns. So the ceiling is
 * derived here rather than tuned, and the price is the input.
 *
 * `ai/budget.ts` had it the other way around: a ceiling picked by hand, with an
 * argument beside it about the price it was picked against. That argument was
 * correct on 21 Aug and silently expires the day a price changes — which is
 * exactly what a placeholder price is for.
 *
 * ── The four inputs, and which of them are decisions ────────────────────────
 *
 *   price            David's. Placeholders today — see `PRICING`.
 *   Apple's cut      15% under the Small Business Program.
 *   the token rate   Google's. Worst case, not typical — see below.
 *   free allowance   ⚠ David's, and the one nobody has made yet.
 *
 * Everything else in this file is arithmetic on those four.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The annual plan is the binding constraint, not the monthly one ────────
 *
 * A ceiling is enforced per calendar month, so the plan that matters is the one
 * earning the least **per month**. An annual subscription at ten months' price
 * earns less monthly than the monthly plan does, and an account on it can spend
 * exactly as much. Deriving from the monthly price would leave every annual
 * subscriber able to cost more than they pay — the failure this file exists to
 * make impossible, arriving through the plan that looks like the safer one.
 *
 * So the floor is the **minimum** net across every plan sold.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Worst case is priced at the Pro rate, not the Flash rate ──────────────
 *
 * The advisor and invoice extraction run on Flash; the dossier runs on
 * `PRO_MODEL`, which bills output at roughly $10/M against Flash's $7.50/M.
 * `decideBudget` counts output-equivalent tokens without recording which model
 * produced them, so a ceiling priced at the Flash rate is only true if no
 * meaningful share of a month's tokens is Pro. That is *usually* true — a
 * dossier is generated once per vehicle and cached, and can't be looped — but
 * "usually true" is not what breakeven-guaranteed means.
 *
 * Pricing every token at the most expensive rate any metered path can reach is
 * the only version of this that is a guarantee rather than an expectation. It
 * costs ~25% of the ceiling and buys the word "cannot".
 *
 * ── What this does NOT protect against ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Input tokens. `decideBudget` measures output only, and `budget.ts` argues
 * that case: output bills at ~12× input on Flash, so input is single-digit
 * percent of a call's cost. Measured on the dossier — 1,054 in against 3,847
 * output-equivalent — input was under 2% of the bill. It is inside the margin
 * the Pro-rate rounding above already buys, and it is stated here rather than
 * left for somebody to discover.
 *
 * ⚠ **Vision is the honest gap.** An invoice photograph bills as input, and no
 * per-scan cost has ever been measured here — `budget.ts` says so about the
 * front door too. A very large image on a very cheap plan is the one path where
 * the guarantee is an argument rather than arithmetic. Measure a scan and this
 * comment either goes away or becomes a number.

 * the numbers a ceiling is computed from should be the numbers actually
 * charged, so this is the constant to change on the day they are set in App

 * tier arriving through a different door, days after it was deleted for exactly
 * that shape.

 * the month's ceiling — about 49,500 output-equivalent tokens at the prices
 * below, a worst case near 50¢ per trial taken. Proportional means it follows
 * the price and the trial length without either being restated, which is the
 * drift this whole file exists to remove.
 *
 * ⚠ It was never enforced. `decideBudget` takes a `Tier` and a trial is not one

 * ⚠ What a free account is allowed to cost — a decision nobody has made, and

 *
 * **A free account earns nothing, so no ceiling makes it breakeven.** The
 * question is not arithmetic, it is what a signup is worth, and that is David's
 * number. `FREE_MONTHLY_COST_USD` is a placeholder sized against the free
 * tier's own legitimate model use, not a considered figure.
 *
 * ── Why a free account can cost anything at all ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `paid-features.ts` says the three paid features "are exactly the three that
 * call a model". **That is not quite true, and here is where it shows.** Health
 * summary generation calls Gemini and sits outside `checkFeatureAccess` — by
 * design, because the health dial is the free product's whole face. So the free
 * tier has one legitimate path that costs us money, and its ceiling has to
 * cover that path without covering an abuse case.
 *
 * At the 400,000-token ceiling that exposure is about **$3.00 a month per free
 * account against zero revenue** — more than the net on an annual subscription.
 * That number was not chosen for this situation; it is inherited from when the
 * tiers differed by allowance rather than by feature.
 *
 * ── ⛔ Why the smaller number is not live ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `PAID_FEATURES_ENFORCED` is off. Until it flips, a free account can still
 * reach the advisor, invoice scanning and the dossier — so the free ceiling is
 * currently the *only* thing standing between a free account and every
 * expensive path in the product. Dropping it to the gated figure today would
 * not save money that is being lost; it would cut every existing account off
 * from the features they can still legitimately use.
 *
 * The two changes are one change, in this order: enforce the gate, then lower
 * this ceiling. `budget.ts` names the pairing at `TIERS`, and
 * `ai-pricing.test.ts` asserts it rather than trusting a comment.
 *
 * ⚠ A health summary has never been measured. The gated figure sizes it against
 * the nearest thing that has — a consultant turn at ~600 output-equivalent
 * tokens — and allows generously for a summary being longer and for several
 * cars. Measure one and this stops being an estimate.

/**

 *
 * David: *"I don't want a free tier. I think we should have a demo view/mode
 * without real LLM calls so prospects can explore the app without costing
 * anything."*
 *
 * That answers the question above by removing it. A prospect who has not paid
 * makes no model call at all, so their worst case is **exactly zero** rather
 * than an acquisition cost somebody has to price. It is a better answer than
 * any number that could have gone in `FREE_MONTHLY_COST_USD`, and it closes the
 * one hole this file could not: health summary generation sits outside the
 * feature gate, so a free account was always going to cost something.
 *
 * The constants above are kept until the change lands, because deleting the
 * free tier is a product build — a demo mode with answers that are not
 * generated, a paywall that is now the front door, and a decision about lapse —
 * not a constant edit. `budget.ts` still ships `TIERS.free`, and it still has to
 * mean something until nothing reads it.
 *
 * ⛔ **The open question is not new users, it is lapsed ones.** `paid-features.ts`
 * argues that a garage which stops working when a subscription ends is a
 * hostage, and the records in it are the owner's own. That argument is about
 * somebody who *did* pay, so "no free tier" does not settle it: a lapsed
 * account still needs to reach its own service history, even if it makes no
 * model calls ever again. Until David answers that, this file describes the
 * pricing and not the entitlement.
