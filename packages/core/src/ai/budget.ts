/**
 * What an account is allowed to spend on Gemini in a month, and what happens

 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase 5.1. Before it, the only control on AI spend was ten calls per minute
 * per vehicle — a ceiling of roughly 432,000 calls a month, which is not a
 * ceiling. `CREWCHIEF_COMMERCIAL_EVAL_2026-08-01.md` puts a daily-use
 * enthusiast at $10.63–$13.57/month against $9.40 net at $9.99, so the tail is
 * not a rounding error, it is the whole margin. Addendum A is blunt that this
 * control "is not optional".
 *
 * ── What this file deliberately does not decide ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The price (D2) and the free-tier shape (D3) are not decided**, and the
 * advisor KB is silent on both — checked, not assumed. So the numbers below are
 * *cost ceilings*, not product tiers, and they are expressed in tokens rather
 * than dollars or features. A token ceiling protects the bill without claiming
 * to know what anyone will pay.
 *
 * `TIERS` is where a new plan gets its ceiling. **Which tier an account is
 * actually on is no longer decided here** — that moved to
 * `@wellkept/core/entitlement`, which reads a stored record against the clock,
 * because a subscription expires and a constant cannot.

/**
 * Ceilings, not plans. ⚠ And as of 30 Aug, ceilings that do not yet satisfy the
 * rule David set for them.
 *
 * `free` is set so an ordinary month of real use does not touch it — the eval's
 * median archetype lands around 200k output-equivalent tokens — while still
 * stopping the runaway case. It is a fuse, not a meter. `paid` was sized on
 * 21 Aug against a $3.99 price.
 *
 * ── ⛔ Neither number is breakeven, and `ai/pricing.ts` is where that is shown ─
 *
 * The requirement is that worst-case usage costs no more than the account
 * earns. At today's placeholder prices the worst-paying plan nets **$2.83 a
 * month** — the annual one, which is the binding plan because a ceiling is
 * monthly — and 1,000,000 output-equivalent tokens costs about **$10** at the
 * most expensive rate a metered path can reach. That is 3.5× the revenue it is
 * supposed to protect, which is this file's own definition of a maximum loss
 * rather than a ceiling.
 *
 * The derived figure is ~283,000. **It is not applied here**, and the reason is
 * the ordering rather than the arithmetic: it is *below* the 400,000 free
 * ceiling, so wiring it in would make the paid tier smaller than the free one.
 * Three guards in `ai-budget.test.ts` caught exactly that and were right to.
 *
 * So the numbers stay until one of three things happens, all of them David's:
 *
 *   1. **The gate is enforced.** `PAID_FEATURES_ENFORCED` is off, so free
 *      accounts still reach every expensive path and 400,000 is the only thing
 *      bounding them. Enforce it and the free ceiling can fall to what the free
 *      tier's own model use costs — see `freeMonthlyOutputTokensWhenGated`.
 *   2. **The price rises**, which raises the derived ceiling with it.
 *   3. **The call gets cheaper.** The dossier is 53% thinking at a level nobody
 *      set — the largest unexamined lever in the bill.
 *
 * `ai-pricing.test.ts` pins the gap so it cannot widen unnoticed, and states
 * what closes it.

/*
  ── ⚠ `entitlementMultiple()` was here, and IAP-06 closed by deletion ────────

  It computed the paid:free ratio so `PaywallScreen` could say the subscription
  "raises that allowance N times over" without the number drifting from `TIERS`.
  That was the right fix for the arithmetic — the copy had claimed **five**
  times against a real 2.5× — and it left the actual problem standing: an
  allowance is not something a customer can see, judge, or relate to their own
  use, so the sentence was unintelligible whatever number went in it.

  The pricing decision of 24 Aug moved the boundary from how much you have used
  to which features you have, so there is **no multiple to state** and the
  sentence is gone rather than corrected. A derived figure nothing renders is
  the same defect in a smaller form.

  ⚠ The ceilings below did not go anywhere and are still enforced. What changed
  is their role: abuse protection behind the gate, never customer-facing copy.
  `paid-features.ts` carries the argument, and this file's own words for `free`
  — "a fuse, not a meter" — are now true of `paid` as well.

/**
 * The public demo's own ceiling.
 *
 * ── Why the demo needs one at all ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is the only unauthenticated surface that calls Gemini. The per-minute
 * limit is ten calls per vehicle and there are three demo vehicles, so the
 * theoretical ceiling was around 1.3 million calls a month — which is not a
 * ceiling, it is a number. An anonymous, publicly invokable model endpoint with
 * no monthly bound is the largest uncontrolled cost in the application, and it
 * was first left uncapped on the argument that capping it risked the portfolio
 * piece. That argument protects the wrong thing: an unbounded bill is not safer
 * than a quiet consultant.
 *
 * ── Two windows, and the daily one is the important half ────────────────────
 *
 * A monthly cap alone fails badly. One bad afternoon exhausts it and the demo's
 * consultant is dead for three weeks — precisely the outcome worth avoiding on
 * a page recruiters are sent to. A daily cap turns that into "quiet until
 * tomorrow", which is survivable, and bounds the month anyway. Whichever binds
 * first wins.
 *
 * ── The arithmetic behind the numbers ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured 2 Aug: a consultant turn runs roughly 450 thinking + 150 output ≈
 * 600 output-equivalent tokens, and Flash output bills around $7.50/M — about
 * $0.0045 a turn.
 *
 *   daily      150,000 ≈   250 turns ≈  $1.13/day
 *   monthly  1,500,000 ≈ 2,500 turns ≈ $11.25/month
 *
 * 250 consultant turns in a day is far more than a portfolio link produces, so
 * an honest visitor never meets the limit. The worst case stops being unbounded
 * and becomes about eleven dollars.

 * The anonymous front door's own ceiling. Phase 2.97a, decision **D8**.
 *
 * ── Why it cannot share the demo's pool ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `checkDemoBudget` keys on `user_id IS NULL`, which today means the seeded
 * demo garage and nothing else. **The moment the front door opens, that
 * predicate matches both surfaces** and two budgets that must stay separate
 * become one. Roadmap D3 is explicit that the anonymous tier needs its own
 * budget line, and it is the more abusable of the two: the demo is three fixed
 * vehicles a visitor can chat to, while the front door accepts an uploaded
 * photograph from anyone.
 *
 * So this keys on `surface = 'anonymous'`, which is exactly what
 * `20260802200000` added the column for.
 *
 * ── D8: this is the primary control, and the ordering is the decision ───────
 *
 * Erratum **T1** corrected the original 2.97a wording, which named IP-bucketed
 * rate limiting as primary. `cc-tech-0003` (**high** confidence) forbids that
 * reasoning: a bucket keyed on a value the caller supplies is decorative, and
 * `X-Forwarded-For` is caller-supplied. A spend ceiling is not — it counts
 * money that has actually been spent, which no header can lie about.
 *
 *   1. **primary**   this ceiling, plus the kill switch
 *   2. *secondary*   per-IP bucketing on the platform-provided client IP
 *   3. always        no dossier generation on this path, ever (D6)
 *
 * David chose no captcha (D8, 3 Aug), on the grounds that a captcha is a
 * conversion tax on the exact surface 2.97d exists to measure.
 *
 * ── Daily only, and that is deliberate ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The demo carries a monthly ceiling as well, because one bad afternoon should
 * not silence it for three weeks. **The front door takes the opposite lesson.**
 * A monthly cap here would mean an attack on the 3rd closes the acquisition
 * surface until the 1st — turning a cost incident into a month with no top of
 * funnel. A daily ceiling bounds the worst case to one day and bounds the month
 * to roughly thirty times it, which is the bill David actually signed up for.
 *
 * ── The arithmetic, and what is honestly not known ──────────────────────────
 *
 * $15/day, at roughly $7.50 per million output-equivalent tokens on Flash:
 *
 *   $15 / $7.50 per M  ≈  2,000,000 output-equivalent tokens per day
 *
 * Expressed in tokens rather than dollars for the same reason `TIERS` is: a
 * token ceiling protects the bill without pretending to know a price.
 *
 * **What is not known is the per-scan cost.** A consultant turn was measured on
 * 2 Aug at ~600 output-equivalent tokens, but the front door adds vision over a
 * full-resolution phone photograph and no such call has ever been made here.
 * Dividing the ceiling by a guessed per-scan figure would be exactly the
 * unearned number `cc-product-0003` exists to stop. **2.97d's meter is what
 * produces the real figure**, and the first week of it should be used to
 * re-set this constant rather than to confirm it.
