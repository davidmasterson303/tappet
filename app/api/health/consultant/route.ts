/**
 * Does the consultant actually answer? — the round-trip gate.
 *
 * ── Why /api/health/ai is not enough ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That route lists models. It proves the credential is accepted, which is the
 * half of §25 that could be checked without spending anything. It cannot prove
 * the consultant *answers*, and the outage it was built for had two causes: a
 * stale key **and** a 403 from our own authorization. A credential check sees
 * only the first.
 *
 * So this asks a real question about a real demo vehicle and reads the answer.
 *
 * ── Why it is behind a shared secret ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `CREWCHIEF_ROUNDTRIP_GATE_DESIGN.md`, decision 1: **close the endpoint
 * rather than making the prompt cheap.** A public endpoint that spends Gemini
 * tokens on request is the unbounded-cost bug §3 already records in
 * `performance-stats`, where demo vehicles fell through to a model call on
 * every anonymous page view. Cost stops being a design problem the moment the
 * caller has to authenticate.
 *
 * The secret is compared in constant time and never echoed. Absent config
 * fails closed: no `CONSULTANT_HEALTH_SECRET` means nobody can run this, which
 * is the safe direction for a route that spends money.
 *
 * ── Why it is not under /api/v1 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Decision 3, and the same reasoning that kept `/api/version` and
 * `/api/health/ai` unversioned in task 2.2: release tooling pins these by
 * path, and versioning them couples the deploy pipeline to the evolution of a
 * product API. Created here so it never has to be moved.
