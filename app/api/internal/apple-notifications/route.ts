/**
 * `POST /api/internal/apple-notifications` — App Store Server Notifications V2.
 *
 * Phase 6, E8. Apple tells us here about everything that happens to a
 * subscription after the purchase: renewals, failed renewals, cancellations,
 * refunds, and lapses. Without it an entitlement would be written once and
 * never corrected, so a cancelled subscription would keep working until its
 * stored expiry and a refunded one would work forever.
 *
 * ── Why this is not under /api/v1, and has no shared secret ─────────────────
 *
 * `/api/v1` is the mobile client's surface and every route there must accept a
 * bearer token (`v1-accepts-bearer.test.ts`). This route accepts no user
 * credential at all, because there is no user: Apple is the caller.
 *
 * It also has no `CRON_SECRET`-style shared secret, and that is a deliberate
 * difference from `/api/internal/notify-sweep` rather than an omission.
 * **The signature is the authentication.** A shared secret would be a second,
 * weaker credential guarding an endpoint that already refuses anything not
 * signed by Apple's root — and it would have to be given to Apple through a
 * URL, which puts it in a dashboard field and in every log line of the request.
 *
 * The URL being public is fine. Nothing here acts on an unverified payload.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Status codes are load-bearing: Apple retries every non-2xx ────────────
 *
 * For up to three days, with backoff. That makes the response code a control
 * signal rather than a formality, and each one below is chosen for what a
 * retry would accomplish:
 *
 *   200  handled, or knowably not ours — never retry
 *   401  not signed by Apple — retrying cannot fix a signature
 *   503  our schema is not ready — retry, and it will succeed once applied
 *   500  something unexpected broke — retry, it may be transient
 *
 * The one worth the most care is **a notification for a transaction we have
 * never seen**. It is tempting to treat that as an error, and a 5xx would make
 * Apple retry it for three days and then give up. But it is not an error: it is
 * a purchase whose `/api/v1/iap/verify` call has not landed yet, or a sandbox
 * purchase made against this bundle id by somebody who never signed in. Neither
 * is fixed by retrying, and one of them is App Review. So it is acknowledged
 * with a 200 and a log line.
