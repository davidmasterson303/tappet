/**
 * The nightly sweep. Phase 5, C1–C3.
 *
 * Reads every vehicle, decides who needs telling, sends the pushes. All of the
 * *deciding* is in `@wellkept/core/notification-sweep` — this file is the IO
 * around it, deliberately, because the decisions are the part that has to be
 * right and they should be testable without a database.
 *
 * ── Why this is not under /api/v1 ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/api/v1` is the mobile client's surface, and every route there is held to
 * accepting a bearer token by `v1-accepts-bearer.test.ts`. This route accepts
 * no user credential of any kind — there is no user. It is infrastructure the
 * scheduler calls, so it lives where that is obvious.
 *
 * ── The authorization, which is the whole risk ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This endpoint sends push notifications to every account in the product. An
 * unauthenticated one would be the most abusable surface in the app by a wide
 * margin — not a data leak, but a way to make Well Kept spam its own users
 * until they uninstall it.
 *
 * So: a shared secret, compared in constant time, and **it fails closed**. If
 * `CRON_SECRET` is unset the route refuses every request rather than running
 * unprotected. That direction matters more than it looks: the natural failure
 * is a deploy where the variable did not get set, and "unconfigured means open"
 * would turn a missing env var into an open relay.
 *
 * ── Dry run ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `?dryRun=1` runs the entire sweep — every query, every decision — and sends
 * nothing. It is how the first production run should be made, and how a
 * suspected runaway is diagnosed without adding to it.

 * running. Both states produced identical evidence: no notifications, no rows,
 * no errors. The canary is the precedent — it sat on a branch that could not
 * fire `schedule` and had never run once, and nothing said so.
 *
 * The `logger.info` above does record it, in Netlify's function logs, behind a

 * dashboard to read is one nobody reads.
 *
 * ── Failure-tolerant, and loudly so ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ Awaited rather than fire-and-forget: this is the last thing the run does,
 * and the request must not return before the row is written or the serverless
 * container can be frozen mid-insert. But a throw here must never fail the
 * sweep — the sweep's job is notifications, and a monitor that can take down
 * the thing it monitors is worse than no monitor.
 *
 * ⚠ So a failed write logs at **error**, and the reason is CLAUDE.md §5: an
 * empty table reads as "the sweep is dead", which is a false alarm if the truth
 * is "the insert failed" — and a guard that cries wolf gets made to pass. The
 * table is absent until `20260822120000` is applied, and every run until then

 * Fill in `lastSignInAt` for each candidate, one lookup per **account**.

 * ── Why this is a separate pass ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fact belongs to the account, not the car. Resolving it inside the scan
 * would look it up once per vehicle, so an owner with four cars would be
 * queried four times a night for the same answer.
 *
 * ── Why the admin API and not a table read ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `last_sign_in_at` lives on `auth.users`, which PostgREST does not expose —
 * CLAUDE.md §2. `auth.admin.getUserById` is the service-role path to it, and
 * this route already holds the service role.
 *
 * ⚠ **A failed lookup leaves `null`, and `null` does not pass the filter.**
 * That direction is deliberate: the failure mode of guessing "active" is a
 * Pro-model call for an account nobody is behind, every night, for every car
 * it owns. The failure mode of guessing "dormant" is a dossier that waits a
 * day. One of those is recoverable by the next sweep and the other compounds.

      one — and every car added on the phone starts in it.

    Put this after it and only the cars that earned a notification would ever
    have a stored next service — which is a quiet way of leaving most of the

    `nextService` rather than `nextMilestone`: the row asks what is next, not
    whether it is worth interrupting someone about. A card that went blank
    because the next service is far away would be hiding the reassuring answer.

    Best-effort. A failed write is not a reason to skip a notification — the

    keeps yesterday's value, which `next_service_updated_at` makes visible.
