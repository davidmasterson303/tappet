  The two embedded selects at the end are the fix for a screen that showed
  *less* than the row it was opened from.

  `/api/v1/vehicles` returns `nhtsa_data(recalls)` and
  `vehicle_health_summary(...)`; this route returned neither. So the mobile
  detail screen declared both, computed a band and a recall count from them,
  and rendered a Health card and a recall card that **could never appear** —
  tapping a garage card reading "70 · FAIR · 2 recalls" led to a screen showing
  no score and no recalls.

  It typechecked because both fields are optional, every test passed, and it
  stayed invisible until the screen was opened for the first time on 5 Aug.
  The detail view of a thing must not know less about it than the list did;
  `vehicle-detail-not-poorer.test.ts` keeps it that way.

  Verified against the live database on the **anon** path specifically, because
  that is the client `authorizeVehicleAccess` hands back for a demo read and an
  embedded select is exactly where RLS would bite: the demo Accord returns
  `health_score: 74` and `recalls: []`.
*/
/*
  ⚠ `recall_actions` and `next_service_*` both added 23 Aug, and both are the
  rule directly above this line
  doing its job: the detail view of a thing must not know less about it than the
  list did. The garage bay names the next service, so the screen you reach by
  tapping that bay has to be able to name it too — and `vehicles/route.ts`
  carries why the three columns were absent from both.

  The recall marks travel because this screen counts **open** recalls — total
  minus what the owner has marked repaired — and a detail view that could not
  subtract them would show a number the garage row it was opened from does not.
  That is the failure this whole file's rule is named after.
*/
/*
  ⚠ `last_generated` travels because **a verdict has to be able to say when it
  was reached.**

  On 23 Aug the M235i's detail screen read "a complete lack of documented
  maintenance … impossible to assess its current condition" while its service
  history listed five records and $1,461. Both were rendering honestly: the
  stored summary was generated on 30 Jul, the line items were filed on 6 Aug,
  and the row has not been recomputed since.

  `generateVehicleHealthSummary` reads `maintenance_line_items` as of 5 Aug,
  so a recompute would now produce the right answer — but nothing on the
  mobile read path performs one, and this route returned no way for the client
  to tell that the sentence it was given predates the records beside it. A
  stale verdict that cannot be recognised as stale is indistinguishable from a
  wrong one, and it tells the owner the app did not read the invoice they just
  scanned.

  One column, and it is what lets the screen refuse to present an out-of-date
  reading as a current one.

      ── The drivers, and how each one fails ────────────────────────────────

      `historyResult.error` is **not** fatal and must not be. A demo read runs

      under RLS, and a detail screen that 500s because it could not enrich a
      card is worse than one that says "no record to count from". So a failed
      history read degrades to no history: every mileage-driven service still
      evaluates from the odometer, and the time-only ones report `unknown`,
      which the maintenance driver is explicitly built not to charge for.

      A missing schedule degrades the same way — `maintenanceDriver` returns a
