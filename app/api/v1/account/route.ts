/**
 * `DELETE /api/v1/account` — App Store guideline 5.1.1(v).
 *
 * ── Why this route exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Apple requires account deletion to be initiated **from inside the app being
 * reviewed**, and routinely rejects "delete your account on our website". The
 * deletion itself has been built and tested since Phase 1 and has now executed
 * end to end against the live database — account, vehicle, profile and storage
 * all verified gone on 1 Aug.
 *
 * What it was not, was *reachable*. `deleteAccount` is a Next.js server action,
 * and a server action is an internal RPC whose client half the bundler
 * generates — a React Native app is not a Next.js client and cannot call one.
 * Exactly the gap that made `/api/v1/consultant` necessary in Phase 3.0.
 *
 * ── The scope of this file is deliberately one call ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `requireSession` already accepts a bearer token: it delegates to
 * `requireCaller` → `resolveCaller`, which resolves either credential type.
 * So `deleteAccount` was already bearer-capable and nothing about the deletion
 * logic needed changing or duplicating.
 *
 * That matters more than it sounds. The ordering inside `deleteAccount` is
 * load-bearing — storage objects have no foreign key, so purging them *before*
 * the cascade is the only thing standing between a deleted account and files
 * orphaned in the bucket forever. A route that reimplemented any of it would be
 * a second answer to "what does deletion mean", and the second answer is the
 * one that drifts.
 *
 * ── Method ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DELETE, not POST. The action is idempotent in the way that matters — a second
 * call from the same caller cannot succeed, because the credential it
 * authenticated with no longer resolves to a user.
 */
/**
 * `GET /api/v1/account` — what the delete screen has to know before it asks.
 *
 * Phase 6, E5. The only thing it reports is whether an App Store subscription
 * is still running, because **deleting an account while Apple keeps charging is
 * a documented rejection reason** and the screen cannot warn about a state it
 * cannot see.
 *
 * ── Why the client is told a boolean and not the row ────────────────────────
 *
 * `expires_at`, `original_transaction_id` and `product_id` are all things the
 * client could render, and none of them are things it needs in order to say
 * "cancel this first". Shipping the transaction id to a device puts Apple's
 * billing identifier somewhere it can be read off a jailbroken phone or a proxy
 * for no benefit at all. The decision — is it live *right now* — is made here,
 * against the server's clock, by the same function the budget path uses.
 *
 * The server's clock matters: a device with a wound-forward date could
 * otherwise talk itself out of the warning.
