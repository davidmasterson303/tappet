/**
 * What an owner has done about a recall.
 *
 * ── Why this route exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The phone could see recalls and could ask the advisor about them, and could
 * do nothing else. A safety notice you cannot ever clear is a notice that stops
 * being read: it sits on the garage chip and the detail banner forever, so
 * after the second week it is furniture rather than information — which is the
 * precise failure mode a permanent red badge has.
 *
 * ⚠ **The storage was already there and already used by the other client.**
 * `recall_actions` has existed since the 14 Mar migration, and `RecallAlerts`
 * on web writes to it from the browser through supabase-js. Mobile cannot do
 * that, and should not: `mobile-api-only.test.ts` forbids a Supabase client on
 * the device, for the reason that file records — a client that talks to tables
 * directly is a second answer to "who may see this", and the second answer is
 * the one that is wrong. So the phone gets a route, and the route is the same
 * authorization every other `/api/v1` path uses.
 *
 * ── ⚠ "Repaired" is the owner's claim, and this route never upgrades it ─────
 *
 * Nothing here verifies anything. NHTSA does not tell us a specific car was
 * fixed — recalls match on **year/make/model, not VIN** (`advice-range.ts`
 * carries that argument, and `CLAUDE.md` §10 makes it a standing rule), so the
 * most this product can honestly hold is *"you told us you had this done, on
 * this date"*.
 *
 * Three consequences, and all three are in the shape of this endpoint rather
 * than in a comment somewhere:
 *
 *   - The row stores `addressed_at`, a **date the owner asserted**, and the
 *     clients render it as such. There is no `verified` column and there must
 *     not be one until something can verify it.
 *   - `DELETE` exists and is a first-class operation, not an admin escape
 *     hatch. A claim someone can make and cannot unmake is a trap, and a
 *     mis-tap on a safety notice is exactly the tap worth being able to undo.
 *   - The recall itself is never deleted or hidden by this route. It returns
 *     *what has been marked*; deciding that a marked recall drops out of the
 *     open count is the client's business, and the notice stays readable.
 *
 * ── The shape, and why GET returns a list rather than a count ───────────────
 *
 * A count would be enough for the garage chip and useless for the recall
 * screen, which has to know **which** campaign was marked and when. Returning
 * the rows lets one request serve both, and it means the chip's number is
 * derived from the same data the detail screen shows rather than from a second
 * number that can disagree with it.

 * client and is written to a `TEXT` column with a `UNIQUE` constraint on it —
 * so an unbounded value is a client choosing how much of our storage one row
 * occupies. The check is deliberately loose about *format*: NHTSA has changed
 * its numbering more than once, and a route that refused a genuine campaign
 * because it did not match a regex would be refusing the safety notice.
