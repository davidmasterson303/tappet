/**
 * `POST /api/v1/iap/verify` — the moment a purchase becomes an entitlement.
 *
 * Phase 6, E8. StoreKit completes a purchase on the device and hands the app a
 * signed transaction. This is where that transaction is checked and, if it is
 * genuine, associated with the account that is signed in.
 *
 * ── ⚠ This route is the only place the association is ever made ─────────────
 *
 * Apple's later notifications carry an `original_transaction_id` and **no
 * user** — Apple has no idea who our accounts are. The link between "this
 * subscription" and "this Well Kept account" exists only because this route saw
 * a signed-in session and a signed transaction at the same moment. Everything
 * the webhook does afterwards is a lookup against what happened here.
 *
 * ── What the client is not trusted for ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything except the JWS. The body carries no product id, no tier, no
 * expiry and no user id, because every one of those would be a value the device
 * could choose. The tier comes from the product id *inside Apple's signature*,
 * and the account comes from the session — never from the payload.
 *
 * This is why `applyVerifiedAppleEvent` takes a user id and an already-verified
 * event: the two facts arrive from different places and neither is allowed to
 * assert the other.
 *
 * ── The transaction that belongs to somebody else ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A signed transaction is genuine no matter who replays it. Somebody who
 * obtains another account's `jwsRepresentation` — from a jailbroken device, a
 * proxy, a shared family device — could otherwise present it and be granted the
 * subscription somebody else is paying for, while the real owner's row is
 * silently rewritten to a different `user_id`.
 *
 * `original_transaction_id` is UNIQUE in the schema, so the write would fail;
 * but a foreign-key style error surfacing as a 500 is not an answer, and the
 * failure would be indistinguishable from a database problem. So the ownership
 * check is explicit and it comes first.
