/**
 * Claim the scans this browser made before signing up. Phase 2.97c.
 *
 * The conversion moment, and the only place `saved` can be recorded — without
 * it that step is vocabulary nothing can ever write, and the conversion rate
 * the whole phase is justified on is structurally uncomputable.
 *
 * ── The visitor id comes from the cookie, never from the caller ─────────────
 *
 * `readVisitorId` reads the **httpOnly** `cc_fv` cookie, which no browser
 * script can read or forge. Accepting an id from a request body instead would
 * let any authenticated user claim any visitor's scan by replaying an id, and
 * ids are visible in the database and in logs. This is the whole authorization
 * story for the rows being moved, so it is not a detail.
 *
 * ── Idempotent, because it is called more than once ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Both signup paths call it — the immediate-session one and the return through
 * `/auth/callback` after email verification — and a user may refresh either.
 * `claimScansForVisitor` only touches rows where `claimed_by IS NULL`, so a
 * second call moves nothing and reports zero. `saved` is recorded only when
 * something actually moved, so a refresh cannot inflate the conversion count.
 *
 * ── Authenticated, unlike everything else on this path ──────────────────────
 *
 * The rest of the front door is deliberately anonymous. This endpoint is the
 * seam where an anonymous session becomes an account, so it is the one part
 * that must know who is asking.
