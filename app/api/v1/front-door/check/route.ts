/**
 * The anonymous front door. Phase 2.97b — no account, no VIN, no dossier.
 *
 * ── The order is the security posture, and it is not local to this file ─────
 *
 * `decideFrontDoorGate` owns it, with tests on the ordering itself, because
 * erratum T1's finding was a *reorder* rather than a missing control — and an
 * ordering is the property that survives review and dies in a handler where
 * every check is individually present. This route supplies inputs and renders
 * the verdict; it does not decide.
 *
 * ── D6: no dossier generation on this path, ever ────────────────────────────
 *
 * A $0.118 Pro dossier firing for anonymous traffic is the most expensive
 * single mistake this surface could make. Nothing here reaches it, and
 * `front-door-gate.test.ts` asserts the absence across every module on the
 * path rather than trusting this comment.
 *
 * ── Why the funnel writes sit where they do ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `uploaded` fires after the gate and before the model call, so it counts
 * people who actually got as far as spending money. `answered` fires only on a
 * usable answer — a rejected upload is not an answer, and counting it would
 * inflate the step the conversion rate divides by. Both are fire-and-forget and
 * cannot fail the request. `landed` is not here: it belongs to the page render
 * and needs middleware, since `cookies()` is read-only during a Server
 * Component render.
