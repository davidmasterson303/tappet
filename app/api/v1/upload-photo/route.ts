/**
 * `POST /api/v1/upload-photo` — a vehicle photograph, from a bearer client.
 *
 * ── Why this route had to exist ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `uploadVehiclePhoto` is a **server action**, which means a cookie session.
 * The phone has no cookie jar — it presents a bearer token — so until now there
 * was no way to add a vehicle photograph from the phone at all.
 *
 * That was not a missing button. David found it on 15 Aug looking at a garage
 * card with no photo and no way to fix it: **the identity plate is a finished
 * design for a car with no photograph, and it was the only state reachable.**
 * A plate you cannot replace is a dead end rather than a fallback.
 *
 * ── The shape is `upload-document`'s, deliberately ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A thin route that authorizes for the **HTTP status** and delegates to the
 * action. The action authorizes too, and that is not redundancy: a server
 * action is an independently reachable POST and always must. What this adds is
 * the status code, which the action cannot express — it returns
 * `{ success: false, error }` and a caller mapping that would fall through to
 * 500 for everything.
 *
 * ⚠ That matters more than it looks. `apps/mobile/src/api/client.ts` keys
 * sign-out off `status === 401`, so on a 500 it never fires: an expired session
 * would show "try again" forever, and trying again cannot help.

      `MAX_STORED_PHOTO_BYTES` exists because this account still holds a
      3000×4000 / 2.3 MB original that **has never once decoded on device** —
      the garage card's timeout exists solely to escape it. Storing another one
      would reintroduce that bug for the next car.

      The web path is protected by a browser-side downscale before upload. The
      phone has no canvas and no image manipulator in this build, so it reduces
      capture quality and cannot guarantee a dimension. Which makes this refusal
      **reachable in normal use on mobile in a way it is not on web** — so the
      reason travels back to the caller intact and is shown to the owner, rather
      than becoming a generic failure they cannot act on.
