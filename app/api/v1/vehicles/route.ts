/*
  ⚠ **`recall_actions` is embedded here as of 23 Aug, and it is what lets the
  recall chip go down.**

  The bay's chip counted every row in `nhtsa_data.recalls`. Once an owner can
  mark a campaign repaired, a chip that cannot go down is a chip that stops
  being read — which is the whole failure mode a permanent red badge has, and
  the reason `/api/v1/recalls` exists at all.

  An embed rather than a second request: the garage draws N cars, and a
  per-vehicle call for a list of campaign numbers would be N round trips for
  something PostgREST returns in the same query. Verified against the live
  database — `recall_actions.vehicle_id` references `vehicles(id)`, so the
  relationship resolves and a car with no marks comes back as `[]`.

  ⚠ Keep the comment **outside** the concatenation.
  `vehicle-detail-not-poorer.test.ts` reads this declaration whole and strips
  quotes and whitespace, so a block comment between the literals becomes six
  imaginary column names. It caught exactly that on the first draft of this
  change.

  ⚠ **The three `next_service_*` columns were missing here until 23 Aug, and
  that is why every bay read "No schedule yet".**

  `GarageBay` has drawn a next-service row since it was built, with a docblock
  saying the migration that adds these columns was "written and **not
  applied**, verified against the live database". That was true when it was
  written and had stopped being true: the columns exist, and the M235i carries
  `next_service_label: 'Engine Oil and Filter Change'` at 170,000 miles. Checked
  against PostgREST rather than against the migrations folder, per §2.

  So the data was there, the component was there, and the **column list was the
  gap** — the honest-unknown branch was rendering on every car in the product
  because this string never asked for the answer. Exactly the failure §1 is
  about: the board said the migration was the blocker, and the artefact said
  otherwise.
*/
/*
  ⚠ `last_generated` travels because **a verdict has to be able to say when it
  was reached.**

  On 23 Aug the M235i's detail screen read "a complete lack of documented
  maintenance … impossible to assess its current condition" while its service
  history listed five records and $1,461. Both were rendering honestly: the
  stored summary was generated on 30 Jul, the line items were filed on 6 Aug,
  and the row has not been recomputed since.

  `generateVehicleHealthSummary` reads `maintenance_line_items` as of 5 Aug,
  so a recompute would now produce the right answer — but nothing on the
  mobile read path performs one, and this route returned no way for the client
  to tell that the sentence it was given predates the records beside it. A
  stale verdict that cannot be recognised as stale is indistinguishable from a
  wrong one, and it tells the owner the app did not read the invoice they just
  scanned.

  One column, and it is what lets the screen refuse to present an out-of-date
  reading as a current one.

 * Add a vehicle to the caller's garage.

 * React Native client presents `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` and carries no
 * cookies, so it cannot call that action at all. Same class as the wishlist GET
 * fixed on 7 Aug, and as the garage route before it.
 *
 * That mattered little while mobile was a companion. From 8 Aug it is the
 * product, and **a person could not create a car on the phone** — there was no
 * sign-up either. This is half of closing that.
 *
 * ── Deliberately fewer fields than the web wizard ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The web action takes fourteen, gathered over a five-step wizard. This takes
 * the four that identify a car plus the two the product actually branches on.
 * Everything else on that row has a sensible default and can be edited later,
 * and a first-run flow that asks for a VIN and a drivetrain before showing
 * anything is a first-run flow people abandon.
 *
 * ── `user_id` is never accepted from the caller ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ownership comes from the verified session. `createVehicle`'s own comment
 * makes the point and it holds harder here: a client-supplied `user_id` on a
 * request body reads as authoritative even when the handler ignores it, which
 * is one careless edit away from being trusted.
 *
 * ── Research is not awaited ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The dossier generation measured ~23s on a warm server. Holding the response
 * open for it would put a half-minute spinner between "add my car" and seeing
 * anything. The row is returned immediately and the knowledge base fills in
 * behind it — `research_status: 'pending'` is what `VehicleInsights` already
 * watches for, so the existing machinery does the rest.

    ── Why this cannot fail the request ────────────────────────────────────────

    Two independent reasons, and either alone would be enough:

    1. **The migration adding `mileage_at_service` and the `'owner-onboarding'`
       source may not be applied yet.** It is written and additive and needs a
       dashboard run. Until then this insert is rejected on a missing column,
       and a request that let that through would mean **nobody can add a car** —
       turning a pending migration into a total outage of the launch-blocking
       flow.

    2. Even once applied, a baseline is an optimisation. The car is the thing
       being created; the baseline improves what the milestone screen can say
       about it later. Losing it costs a service being estimated rather than
       counted, which is exactly the behaviour every car has today.

    Same posture as the knowledge-base insert above, for the same reason: what
    the caller asked for was a vehicle.
