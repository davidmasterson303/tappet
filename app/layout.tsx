     The favicon, apple-touch-icon and SVG icon are NOT declared here — they

     same filename convention as opengraph-image.tsx below.

     ✅ **They are generated together again as of 7 Sep.** This block used to
     record a gap: `icon.svg` carried the Well Kept plate while `favicon.ico`,
     `apple-icon.png` and the manifest's two PNGs were still the *Sweep dial* —
     two logos ago — because regenerating them needed a rasteriser with
     Newsreader loaded, and nothing on this machine had one.

     The identity redraw removes the dependency rather than satisfying it: the
     package's type is outlined to paths, so `docs/brand-package-v2/build.py`
     rasterises every size from geometry with no font involved. All four come
     out of one run.

     ⚠ `icon.svg` is the one a modern browser takes, and it swaps polarity
     itself through a `prefers-color-scheme` media query inside the file — which
     no raster can do. `favicon.ico` is the fallback and carries its own tile,
     because a transparent raster favicon has to pick a polarity and one
     polarity is always wrong: the tab simply looks empty, and nothing reports
     it.

          Archivo carries a real `wdth` axis, which is what makes it the
          instrument voice rather than a narrow face pretending to be one: the
          masthead sets it at 62 and the section headings at 88, from one file.
          The range is clipped to 62..100 and 500..800 — the only widths and

          It has to be a blocking inline script, and the two alternatives are

          first and the curtain drops *onto* it — which is exactly what the
          old GarageDoorAnimation did, with its inverted `if (!shouldRender)
          return null`. Rendering the curtain unconditionally and hiding it on
          the client means every returning visitor gets a flash of door.

          Same technique next-themes already uses two lines below to avoid a
          flash of the wrong theme, for the same reason.

          The catch is not defensive padding: sessionStorage throws outright,
          not returns null, in a partitioned or storage-blocked context. Any
          failure resolves to 'skip', so the worst case is no intro rather
