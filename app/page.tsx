 * The nav actions on a page anyone can reach.

 * that arrives from a portfolio link, that is an auth wall as a first
 * impression, and it was the only CTA in the nav.
 *
 * While the session is still resolving, the signed-out pair is rendered rather
 * than a gap: `/` is public and most of its traffic is anonymous, so that is
 * both the likely answer and the one that avoids a hole in the nav.

 * again. This nav is the only surface that stays with them, so it is where the
 * pitch has to survive. Sign-up is still reachable via `/login`'s "Sign up

        system already provides, rather than deleting a documented element.

            `min-h-screen` on the wrapper against three cards of content left
            the bottom of a tall viewport as undifferentiated gradient — no
            footer, no ground, no closure, so it read as a document that had
            not finished loading rather than as composed space.

            A rule and one line of type is enough to close it, and the line is
            load-bearing rather than filler: it says what the demo is, which is
            the sentence the masthead carries on the demo host and which the
            product host has nowhere else to put. `min-w-0` so the row can
            shrink; the two halves stack on a phone.

              been researched end to end — issues, schedule and open recalls",
              which restated the hero line within the same single screen. On a
              one-viewport page that is filler; the footer closes the page and
              the hero is trusted to have said it.

              ⚠ Not mono. A design critique counted four type voices on this
              screen — small-caps serif on the plate, display serif in the
              headline, sans in the body and buttons, and monospace here — and
              named this one: "the mono footer in particular is a developer's
              flourish, not the sign-painter's."

              It is right. Monospace says *machine* on a page whose whole
              argument is that a person keeps the record.

              ⚠ And it is **not** letterspaced small caps either, which was the
              first replacement and made things worse: the next round counted
              that gesture three times on one screen — the plate, its maker
              line, and this — and called three "a tic". Twice is discipline. A
              colophon can simply be a sentence.
