/**
 * ⚠ **This is a draft and has not been reviewed by a lawyer.** It is written to
 * be *accurate* — every claim below was checked against the live database, the
 * tree, or `APP_STORE_PRIVACY_ANSWERS_2026-08-12.md`, which was itself derived
 * by audit rather than from a planning document. Accuracy is the part a lawyer
 * cannot supply and the part that is expensive to fix later; the legal framing
 * is the part they can.
 *
 * ── Why it exists now ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * App Store Connect requires a privacy policy URL as a mandatory listing field,
 * and guideline 3.1.2 requires a functional in-app link once auto-renewable
 * subscriptions ship (E8). Neither page existed anywhere in this product on
 * 14 Aug — not on web, not in the app — and the requirement was tracked only in
 * David's runbook, so it appeared in no effort total on the board.
 *
 * ── The specific claims that were checked, and how ──────────────────────────
 *
 * - **No tracking, no advertising, no analytics.** There is no IDFA, no
 *   `expo-tracking-transparency`, and no PostHog, Plausible, Mixpanel,
 *   Amplitude or Segment in the project. `privacy-manifest.test.ts` fails if a
 *   tracking SDK is added without the manifest changing with it.
 * - **The VIN leaves the product.** `app/actions.ts:139` sends it to NHTSA's
 *   public decoder. That is a real third-party disclosure and is named below
 *   rather than folded into "vehicle details".
 * - **Deletion purges storage before the row cascade** — `deleteAccount` in
 *   `lib/account-data.ts`, storage first so no object is orphaned by the
 *   cascade that would otherwise remove its only reference.
 *
 * ── What is still unsettled — the page is already published ─────────────────
 *
 * This heading used to read "before this is published", and that framing
 * expired on 17 Aug: the page went live on `crewchief.davidmasterson.co`, which
 * is the privacy-policy URL in the App Store listing. It is not a draft waiting
 * for a launch date; it is what App Review reads.
 *
 * ✅ Both are named — `CONTACT_EMAIL` on 19 Aug, and `OPERATOR` twice: David
 * personally on 18 Aug, then **Southmoor Digital LLC on 30 Aug** once the
 * company existed. Nothing bracketed renders below any more, and `LAST_UPDATED`
 * moves with them because who operates a service and how to reach them is the
 * substance of the document rather than its trim. See `lib/legal.ts` for why
 * the contact is deliberately not a domain address.
 *
 * ⛔ **The operator on the live page is still the person, not the company.**
 * This file changed on 30 Aug; `web-live` has been frozen since 23 Aug, so the
 * document App Review reads names David until a promote runs. The date in
 * `lib/legal.ts` is written for the day it ships, not the day it was edited.

    >
      <p>
        This policy describes what {OPERATOR} collects through the Well Kept app and website, why,
        who else is involved, and how to get rid of it.
      </p>

      <LegalSection>What we collect</LegalSection>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">Your account.</strong> An email address and a password.
        The password is held by our authentication provider and is never visible to us. A display
        name is optional, free text, and never required — Well Kept does not ask for your legal
        name.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">Your vehicles.</strong> Year, make, model, trim, mileage,
        and — if you provide them — the VIN and a ZIP code. The ZIP is typed by you and used to fill
        in a quote request. The app never reads your location from your device; there is no location
        permission because nothing asks for one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">What you upload.</strong> Vehicle photographs and images of
        service invoices, plus the text extracted from those invoices. This is worth stating
        plainly rather than calling it &ldquo;photos&rdquo;: a repair invoice routinely carries your
        name, the shop&rsquo;s name and address, and sometimes the VIN. All of it is stored.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">What you write.</strong> Conversations with the advisor,
        wishlist entries, and notes on service records.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">Notifications.</strong> If you allow them, a push token and
        a random identifier generated by the app on first install. That identifier is not a hardware
        ID, is not shared with anyone, cannot be matched to you in any other app, and disappears when
        you delete the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">Use of the AI features.</strong> One record per request —
        what it was for, which model answered, and how many tokens it used. These exist to enforce a
        spending limit on each account. They are not product analytics, and there is no analytics
        service in this product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">Before you have an account.</strong> The public website
        records anonymous visit and scan events against a random browser identifier so we can tell
        whether the site works. There is no account attached, because there is not one yet.
      </p>

      <LegalSection>What we do not collect</LegalSection>

      <p>
        No advertising identifier. No third-party analytics, attribution or crash-reporting service.
        No contacts, browsing history, or search history. No health data. No payment details of any
        kind — if you subscribe, Apple handles the payment and your card never reaches us. We do not
        track you across other companies&rsquo; apps or websites, and we do not sell or share your
        information with data brokers.
      </p>

      <LegalSection>Who else sees it</LegalSection>

      <p>
        Well Kept is built on services that necessarily process your data to work:
      </p>

      {/*
        The bullets inherit their colour rather than carrying a dimmed one of
        their own. A separately tinted list marker reads as unclassifiable to
        the contrast scan, which cannot tell a bullet from body text — and the
        honest answer is that the rule needs no exemption here, because
        inheriting looks fine.
      */}
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white/90">Supabase</strong> — database, file storage, and account
          authentication. Everything described above is stored here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white/90">Netlify</strong> — hosting for the website and the app&rsquo;s
          backend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white/90">Google</strong> — the advisor and the dossier are generated
          by Google&rsquo;s Gemini models. The vehicle details relevant to your question are sent to
          Google to produce an answer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white/90">Apple</strong> — delivers push notifications, and handles
          billing if you subscribe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-white/90">NHTSA</strong> — the US National Highway Traffic Safety
          Administration&rsquo;s public API. If you provide a VIN, it is sent to NHTSA to decode what
          the car actually is. Recall checks send the make, model and year only.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <LegalSection>Deleting your account</LegalSection>

      <p>
        You can delete your account from inside the app or the website, without asking anyone. It is
        immediate rather than scheduled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deletion removes your uploaded files first, then your account and every record attached to
        it — vehicles, invoices, conversations, wishlist, notifications and usage records. What
        survives is a single line in our own operational log recording that an account was deleted,
        how many vehicles it held, and how many files were removed. It contains no personal
        information, and exists so we can tell that deletion is working.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong className="text-white/90">Deleting your account does not cancel an App Store
        subscription.</strong> Only you can do that, through Apple — see the Terms.
      </p>

      <LegalSection>Children</LegalSection>

      <p>
        Well Kept is not directed at children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect information
        from them.
      </p>

      <LegalSection>Changes</LegalSection>

      <p>
        If this policy changes in substance, the date at the top changes with it. That date does not
        move for corrections to wording or layout.
      </p>
