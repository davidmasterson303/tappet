/**
 * Service history, read from what was actually extracted.
 *
 * ── What this page used to be ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every line of it was fabricated, and the fabrication was labelled as
 * verified. A `MOCK_MAINTENANCE_DATA` constant held two invented records —
 * "Performance Auto Shop, 64,200 mi, $1,245.00" — rendered for *every* vehicle,
 * so a 2012 Sierra with 1 mile on it displayed someone else's brake job. Each
 * carried an **AI Verified** badge. "View PDF" called `handleDownloadFakePDF`,
 * a function named for what it was, which downloaded nothing and toasted
 * "AI extraction confidence: 99.2%" — a fabricated confidence score for a
 * fabricated record. The heading credited "Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision", a model
 * this app has never called.
 *
 * The worst part was not that it was fake. It is that **the real data existed
 * and this page hid it.** Uploading an invoice through the Consultant writes
 * genuine rows to `maintenance_line_items` — a corpus run on 30 Jul added five
 * from one invoice — and a user who did that came here and saw two invented
 * records about a car that is not theirs.
 *
 * So this is not a feature being built. It is a working feature being shown.
 *
 * ── The upload button ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was a stub: `toast.info('Upload feature available in full version')`, no
 * network call. There is an unused server action, `uploadInvoiceToMaintenance-
 * Items`, that could have been wired to it — and wiring it would have created a
 * second upload path beside the Consultant's working one. Two implementations
 * of one job is the exact shape of every cache bug found this week. The button
 * now sends you to the Consultant, which is where invoice upload actually
 * lives and works.

                      critique counted five of on one screen: "the tell of a
                      design leaning on a single trick." The date is a date
                      now, set plainly, and the shop is the quieter half above
                      it.

                      ── ⚠ The line prices were here all along ────────────────

                      Three design critiques asked for them — "a ledger without
                      numbers on its lines is not a ledger", "the core object of
                      this screen is under-designed" — and I refused twice, on
                      the claim that `total_cost` was the visit's total repeated
                      on every row.

                      That was wrong, and checkable in one query: the M3's
                      January visit is 89 + 28 + 155 + 145 + 378 + 220 = 1015,
                      which is exactly the total this card was already printing.
                      `groupIntoVisits` **sums** the column — if it held the
                      visit total per row the figure would have been six times
                      too large, and the page would have said so from the first
                      screenshot.

                      CLAUDE.md §1: verify against the artefact, never the
                      board. I had a belief about a column and did not query it.

                      ⚠ Rhythm, not a metronome: no rule between items — a
                      critique counted "six identical hairlines inside one card"
                      — spacing separates the lines and the only rule is the one
                      above the total, which is where an invoice puts it.

                        ⚠ Serif, and this is the one place on the page it earns
                        the exception to "never tabular data".

                        A critique: the serif "appears exactly three times…
                        everything else is generic bold sans. '$1,015.00' in
                        heavy grotesk is the loudest element on every card and
                        belongs to a different, cheaper product." It is right —
                        the total is the visit's headline, and it was set in the
                        UI face.

                        The rule it bends is `display-serif`'s ban on tabular
                        data, which exists because the cluster reading counts up
                        and Newsreader would reflow the digits mid-animation.
                        Nothing here animates: this figure is printed once and
                        never moves.
