/*
 * The share card, generated rather than stored.
 *
 * The audit that prompted this found two faults on the same line of
 * `app/layout.tsx`: the card pointed at `/garage-interior-1920.jpg`, an image
 * whose licence public/CREDITS.md could not establish, and it pointed at it
 * *relatively* with no `metadataBase` — so Next 13.5 resolved it against
 * `http://localhost:3000` and every deployed share card asked scrapers to
 * fetch an image from their own machine. The portfolio link has been sharing
 * a broken preview.
 *
 * Deleting the photograph fixes the licence and breaks the card, so the card
 * needed a replacement first. This is it: the same service-bay recipe as
 * `.service-bay` in globals.css, rendered to PNG at build time. Nothing to
 * licence, no binary in the repo to drift from the stylesheet, and no fetch
 * of a 142 KB JPEG when a scraper comes calling.
 *
 * Next finds this file by convention — the filename is the API. It emits the
 * `og:image` and `twitter:image` tags itself, at the right absolute URL, which
 * is why `layout.tsx` no longer declares `images` at all. `metadataBase` still
 * has to be set there: convention-based routes are resolved against it too.
 *
 * Written with stacked absolute divs rather than the stylesheet's single
 * background-layer stack. This renders through Satori, not a browser, and
 * Satori takes a subset of CSS — no `background-size` per layer, no
 * `repeating-linear-gradient`. The values are the stylesheet's; keep them in
 * step by hand, there are only nine.
 *
 * The batten is drawn here even though `.service-bay` never carried one and the
 * app no longer does either — the nav's cyan hairline was cut on 4 Sep after
 * successive design critiques read it as "a leftover from another theme".
 *
 * ⚠ It survives on this card deliberately, and the distinction is the point:
 * what was cut is a *chrome* element, a rule under a nav competing with the
 * page's own accents. This is a single composed frame with no chrome in it, so
 * the fixture reads as what the concept drew — a light below an implied
 * ceiling — rather than as a stray line. It is the one surface where the
 * original single-layer composition is still the right one.

          ── The plate, restated because Satori renders JSX and not components ─

          `BrandLockup` cannot be used here: this renders through Satori, which
          takes a JSX tree rather than a React component tree with our imports.
          What it *can* share is the numbers — the path, the rivets and the
          colours come from `@wellkept/core/brand`, so the card cannot drift
          from the mark the app draws even though the drawing is restated.

          ⚠ The engraved name is set in Satori's default face, not Newsreader.
          Loading a webfont here means a network fetch inside `next build`, and
          this build is the promote gate for the hostname the App Store points
          at — a font CDN having a bad minute would fail a deploy. Design's own
          README makes the matching point about rasterisers substituting fonts;
          the honest version at this size is the plate carrying capitals in the
          face that is actually present.

            Satori refuses SVG text outright — *"<text> nodes are not currently
            supported, please convert them to <path>"* — and the way it refuses
            is the dangerous part: the route still answers **200 with
            `content-type: image/png` and a zero-byte body**. A scraper sees a
            valid response and a broken picture, and nothing in the app looks
            wrong. Caught by generating the card and measuring it; it would not
            have shown up in any test that reads source.

            So the plate is drawn as paths, which Satori does support, and the
            engraved name is a positioned div, which is how the wordmark on
