/*
 * Visual states for the invoice scanner's progress panel. Development only.
 *
 * ── ⚠ Why this page exists at all (UX-15) ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The component it renders used to drive itself from a `setInterval` over four
 * hard-coded stages, advancing with `(prev + 1) % steps.length`. The modulo
 * **wrapped**, so any upload slower than 8.5 seconds ticked the final stage
 * green and then began the first one again — the panel announced the work
 * complete two or three times while it was still running.
 *
 * That shipped and stayed shipped, and the reason is visible from here: the
 * only way to see this component was to upload a real invoice, on a real
 * account, and watch. Nobody watches a loader for nine seconds. On a page like
 * this it would have been obvious in one screenful.
 *
 * The states below are the ones the upload loop can actually produce. If a
 * change to the panel cannot be checked here, add the state — the same rule
 * `card-states` carries, for the same reason.
 *
 * ⚠ These are fixtures, not live scans. The panel is a pure function of its
 * props now, which is what makes them sufficient: there is no internal clock
 * left for a fixture to fail to reproduce.
