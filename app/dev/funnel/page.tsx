/**
 * The front door's funnel, read out loud. Development only.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Advisory P1 made instrumentation a **ship gate**, on the argument that
 * Phase 2.97 is justified by producing evidence and this is the only part of it
 * that produces any. That argument is only true if someone can read the result.
 * Four steps recording into a table nobody opens is the same outcome as no
 * instrumentation, arrived at more expensively.
 *
 * `readFunnel` and `funnelRates` existed and had no caller. This is the caller.
 *
 * ── Development only, and that is not laziness ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `notFound()` in production, matching `app/dev/rls-check`. The numbers here
 * are business data — how many strangers arrived and how many converted — and
 * there is no admin role in this application to gate them behind. Inventing one
 * for a readout would be a larger security surface than the readout is worth.
 * When this needs to be visible in production it should go behind the same
 * decision that creates a real admin concept, not ahead of it.
 *
 * ── It shows an empty funnel as empty ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `funnelRates` returns zeroes rather than NaN on no data, which is the normal
 * state until the door is promoted. A page reading "0 visitors" is correct and
 * legible; one reading "NaN%" looks broken on the days it is telling the truth.
