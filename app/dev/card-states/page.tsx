/*
 * Visual states for the garage card. Development only.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The demo garage cannot exercise this component. Demo vehicles carry no
 * `healthSummary` and no recalls, so the score ring and the alert ribbon — the
 * two things v7 is actually about — render on no page a developer can open.
 * That is not a new gap: the v6 notes carried "E4 is unverified on screen"
 * forward for exactly this reason, and the fix offered there was "confirm on a
 * real account", which nobody can do from a local checkout.
 *
 * Every band, both alert tones, the photo-less card and the score-less card are
 * below. If a change to VehicleCard cannot be checked here, add the state.
 *
 * ── Not reachable in production ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `notFound()` on a production build, so this never ships a route to the demo
 * domain. It is a harness, not a feature, and it renders fixture text that
 * would read as real content to anyone who found it.

  /*
   * A deliberately NON-demo id.
   *
   * The first version of this page reused the Accord's demo UUID, and every
   * card rendered the Accord photograph under "2019 BMW M3" text — because
   * VehicleCard hard-overrides demo vehicles from @wellkept/core/demo's DEMO_IMAGES and
   * ignores image_url entirely for them. Useful accident: it is a live
   * demonstration of the two-sources-of-truth problem that A6 exists to delete.
   *
   * A non-demo id also means the delete and mileage paths are not short-circuited
   * by the demo guards, so do not click Delete here — the row does not exist.
