 * `/onboard` — the returning-user guard, then the form.

 * Task 1.6's third done-condition. This is a server component so the decision
 * is made before anything is sent: a client-side redirect would render the
 * onboarding form to someone who has already onboarded and then replace it,
 * which is the flash the done-condition is really about.
 *
 * The policy — why vehicle count and not the profiles row, and why an
 * explicit visit from the garage is exempt — is in `lib/onboarding.ts`.
 *
 * Anonymous visitors do not get here: `/onboard` is in `PROTECTED_ROUTES` and
 * the middleware sends them to `/login` with a redirect back.
