        * <rootDir>/.claude/worktrees/…/package.json

    (it read `crewchief` before the 30 Aug rename, and the worktrees still hold
    checkouts from before it — so the names collide differently now, and the
    reason to ignore the path has not changed.)

    once for the root package and once for @wellkept/core. Noise rather than a
    failure, which is the problem: a real warning appearing above 50 passing
    suites is invisible next to two that always fire. Every verification today
    started by reading past them.

    This ignores the paths at the module-resolution layer, which is the one the
