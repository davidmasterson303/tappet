# CrewChief roadmap — image pipeline, backdrop, cockpit direction, and responsive web

Source: `Live-Site Audit.dc.html` (2 Aug 2026), grounded in repo `davidmasterson303/crewchief@main` (aa1d73f) and the live demo. Finding refs (F1–F8) and concept refs (1a–1c, 2a–2c) point into that report. Advisor KB was offline for the audit; reconcile against it when reconnected, and stage a `kb_propose` for the decisions below.

---

## Status — 2 Aug 2026, afternoon session

**Live on production.** `crewchief-demo.davidmasterson.co` is serving `e7f14df7`
(the `demo-live` merge), promoted from `main` at `1ec6e68` through
`scripts/promote-demo.mjs`. All gate checks passed first time; `verify-demo.mjs`
green against prod afterwards, with the two standing warnings.

**The whole day is live** — RP1, R4, R8, R11, R12, Phase 2.95 a/b/c, 5.1, the
demo cap, the server-side photo bound, item 17's contrast fix, Phase 3.3's
account-deletion screen, and all four of Cowork's QA findings. Nothing is
sitting unpromoted.

**Verified on prod after the promote, at the widths that could not be reached
locally:** `/` at 375 — horizontal overflow 0 and `textUnder12px` **0**, down
from the baseline's 1, exactly as Cowork predicted when it identified that node
as the banner link. `/` at 700 — two 314px columns, against the single 652px
column it measured on `e729ee96`. `/consultant` at 375 — composer on screen,
thread scrolling, zero overflow in either axis.

| | Items | |
|---|---|---|
| **Done** | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 | 12 |
| **Partial** | 13, 15 | 2 |
| **Open** | 5, 12, 14, 18 | 4 |
| **Done (work stream B)** | RB0, R1, R2, R3, R5, R6, R9, R10, R15, R4, R8, **R11, R12** | 13 |
| **Invalid (work stream B)** | **R13, R14** — both target components nothing renders | 2 |
| **Open (work stream B)** | R7 — folds into item 14 | 1 |

**Work stream B is finished, except for a decision that is not a fix.** RB0,
RP0, RP1 and RP2 are all closed — R4, R8, R11 and R12 landed this afternoon.
**R13 and R14 are invalid**: both describe real defects in components that no
route renders, and the live equivalents do not have those defects. Deleting or
wiring those two components is David's call. R7 remains folded into item 14.

Every item below carries a status line. **Handoff notes are at the bottom of
this file** — read those first if you are picking this up cold.


## P0 — this week (portfolio-share and sign-up paths)

### 1. Fix the social preview image (F1)
> **DONE.** `metadataBase` added, reading `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` with the production
> literal as fallback so an unset variable degrades to *correct for prod*, never back to
> localhost. `openGraph.images` is gone entirely — `app/opengraph-image.tsx` generates the
> card at build time and Next emits the tags itself. **Verified on prod:** og:image is
> absolute, returns 200 `image/png`, and the deployed HTML contains zero `localhost`.

- **Problem:** `app/layout.tsx` sets `openGraph.images` as a relative URL with no `metadataBase`, so deployed HTML resolves it to `http://localhost:3000/garage-interior-1920.jpg`. Every share card from the portfolio link renders blank.
- **Change:** add `metadataBase: new URL('https://crewchief-demo.davidmasterson.co')` to the metadata export in `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Verify:** view-source on the deployed page — `og:image` must be an absolute production URL; re-scrape with a link-preview debugger.
- **Effort:** one line.

### 2. Stop auth pages fetching the 480 KB master (F2)
> **DONE**, via the "real" change rather than the interim one — all five surfaces took the
> CSS plate, so they ship no photograph at all. Guarded by a new test
> (`lib/__tests__/image-weight-budget.test.ts`) that fails if any auth page or `/` ever
> references a raster file again.

- **Problem:** login (`:131`), signup (`:110, :172, :194`), forgot-password (`:46, :75`), reset-password (`:109`) all background `dark-roomb.jpeg` (3333×2000, 480 KB) behind a 60–85% black scrim. The 142 KB 1920-wide derivative already exists.
- **Change (interim):** point all seven refs at `/garage-interior-1920.jpg`.
- **Change (real):** these pages take the CSS plate (item 3) and stop shipping a photo at all.
- **Effort:** minutes.

### 3. Replace the backdrop with a built environment; delete the unprovenanced photo (§02)
> **DONE.** `.service-bay` in globals.css, `.service-bay-dim` on auth. Both JPEGs deleted
> (404 on prod, confirmed); `public/CREDITS.md` closed with the agreed wording.
>
> One deviation: the batten is **not** a layer of the plate. At the mockup's 440px height
> 12% landed exactly on the nav's bottom edge — that coincidence is the design — but at a
> real 720px viewport 12% is 86px, *inside* an opaque nav, invisible. It mounts on the nav
> as `.bay-batten`, which also collapses concept 2b into the same rule.

- **Problem:** the garage backdrop is the site's only asset with unknown provenance — photographer unknown, source unknown, EXIF stripped, "believed Unsplash" (indistinguishable from paid Unsplash+ post-download). `public/CREDITS.md`'s own recommendation is replace, not re-trace. It's also disliked aesthetically and is the main pop-in offender (F4).
- **Change:** ship concept **1a "Service bay"** as the backdrop on `/` — a CSS-built environment (graphite gradient base, one cyan LED batten with radial wash, wall/floor horizon hairline, sealed-concrete floor band with faint cyan reflection, faint wall-panel seams, vignette). Auth pages get a dimmed variant: LED wash at ~40%, deeper vignette — one variable.
- **Then:** delete `public/dark-roomb.jpeg` and `public/garage-interior-1920.jpg`; close the open item in `public/CREDITS.md` with "replaced by a built environment — no licence to record." Hold concept **1c "Cockpit ambient"** (brushed beltline + ambient strip) for the dashboard in P3 so the two screens rhyme.
- **Why CSS, not another photo:** 0 KB vs 142–480 KB per page; no licence ever; paints with the stylesheet (F4 dissolves); crisp at every viewport/DPR; tunable per surface.
- **Effort:** about half a day including deletion + CREDITS.

## P1 — next

### 4. Modern formats and sizes for all photography (F3)
> **DONE**, but not where the item said. `photography/build_assets.py` **does not exist and
> never has** — see the note under item 12. Written as `scripts/build-image-derivatives.mjs`
> (`npm run build:images`, needs the new `sharp` devDependency).
>
> 5.31 MB JPEG → 1.46 MB AVIF (73% smaller). Served via `image-set()` behind an
> `@supports` guard, not `<picture>`: the photo surfaces are CSS backgrounds, which no
> image component can express. The `unoptimized` flag stays and that is now a decision —
> the optimizer only sees `next/image`, and this app renders none. The `remotePatterns:
> '**'` wildcard was removed (it would have made `/_next/image` an open proxy the moment
> anyone dropped that flag).

- **Problem:** `next.config.js` sets `images: { unoptimized: true }`, nothing uses `next/image`, every photo is a fixed-size JPEG. Vehicle heroes run 660–950 KB (WRX portrait 948 KB).
- **Change:** extend `photography/build_assets.py` (already regenerates all derivatives from masters) to emit AVIF + WebP beside each JPEG; swap call sites to `<picture>` with JPEG fallback. Expect ≥50% weight reduction at equal quality.
- **Alternative:** verify the Netlify runtime version — if Runtime v5+, `next/image` is wired to Netlify Image CDN and the `unoptimized` flag may simply predate that; removing it could replace the manual pipeline. Check before building.
- **Effort:** ~1 day.

### 5. Preload any surviving LCP photo (F4 residue)
> **OPEN — and largely moot, but not closed honestly.** `/` and the auth screens no longer
> carry a photograph at all, so the item is satisfied there by removal. The dashboard hero
> still does, and a static `<link rel=preload>` **cannot** name it: the URL comes from a
> client-side query and then a Supabase signed-URL exchange, so it is not knowable at HTML
> time. Injecting the link after the URL is known gains nothing over the browser's own
> discovery.
>
> What shipped instead, addressing the same symptom: `fetchpriority="high"` on the hero's
> request, and an inlined blur-up fill that paints before the photograph resolves.
> A real preload needs the dashboard to server-render its vehicle — a bigger change.

- **Change:** for any page that still carries a photographic backdrop or hero, add `<link rel="preload" as="image">` in the head (background-image in a client component is otherwise discovered post-hydration).
- **Effort:** ~1 hour.

### 6. Delete the Google image-search pipeline (F5)
> **DONE.** `lib/vehicle-images.ts` deleted, call site removed from `app/actions.ts`, both
> `GOOGLE_SEARCH_*` keys removed from `.env.example` (the env-parity ratchet checks both
> directions). `image_url` stays on the row and is still read as a fallback for the seeded
> demo vehicles — nothing writes it from a search any more.

- **Problem:** `lib/vehicle-images.ts` hotlinks whatever Google Custom Search returns for user vehicles — third-party images with no licence, from URLs that rot. The search key expired 28 Jul, so it already returns nothing; its Unsplash fallback URL 404'd in production (documented in the file's own comments).
- **Change:** remove the pipeline and its env keys. Owner upload (which already downscales client-side with EXIF orientation handled) plus the make-derived identity plate covers every case with zero third-party risk. `VehicleIdentity`'s docblock already declares the plate "the primary design, not the fallback."
- **Effort:** ~1 hour.

### 7. Cluster gauge replaces the donut (2a)
> **DONE**, hero and card both. `components/ClusterGauge.tsx`.
>
> Worth knowing: the "donut" the item describes is `ScoreRing` in `HealthSummary.tsx`, and
> it only renders in that file's `compact` branch, **which has no call sites** — D5 had
> already removed it from the dashboard. Replacing it would have restyled something nobody
> sees. What is actually on the dashboard was a numeral plus a separate linear band scale,
> and that is what the dial replaced.
>
> Built to the geometry in this file: viewBox `200×178`, butt caps, minors every 5, majors
> at 0/20/40/60/80/100 carrying the numbers, needle + hub. The reading sits below the hub —
> centring it in the well is not available once there is a hub, and the 178 crop is exactly
> the line it sits on.

- **Problem:** health is rendered as a closed 360° conic donut with rounded caps and drop-shadow glow — reads "SaaS progress ring," carries severity by color alone.
- **Change:** the 270° cluster dial, open at the bottom like a tachometer:
  - butt-capped arc stroke, hairline minor ticks every 5, majors at 0/20/40/60/80/100 carrying the numbers;
  - band thresholds 40/60/80 sit brighter on the dial;
  - needle + hub; numeral stays Inter tabular (`.num`) per the type rule; band token drives arc, needle position, numeral and label together (Good ≥80 / Fair ≥60 / Needs attention ≥40 / Critical <40 — never hand-labelled);
  - dashboard hero first; the garage card ring adopts the ticked dial at card size (56px slot) after.
- **Geometry (from the working concept):** viewBox 0 0 200 178, center (100,100), r=70; track `M 50.5 149.5 A 70 70 0 1 1 149.5 149.5`; score arc = same path with `pathLength="100"`, `stroke-dasharray="{score} 100"`; needle rotation = `2.7 × score − 135` degrees.
- **Effort:** ~1 day.

## P2 — later

### 8. Photo fade-in on signed-URL swap (F6)
> **DONE.** 200ms, keyed on the URL so a re-minted signed URL fades its replacement in
> rather than flashing the plate.
>
> Non-obvious: `onLoad` alone is a bug. This is a client component, so Next renders it to
> HTML on the server and the browser can finish fetching from cache *before* hydration
> attaches any handler — the event fires with nothing listening and the photo stays at
> `opacity: 0` forever. The element is also asked directly on mount, with `naturalWidth`
> separating a finished load from a finished failure.

- Signed-URL resolution collapses pending → "no photo," so the identity plate renders first and the photograph replaces it in one frame. Add a 200ms opacity fade on image load. Nothing else — layout stability is already right. (~1 hour)

### 9. Ambient hairline + machined wells + ignition sweep (2b, 2c, motion spec)
> **DONE**, all three. 2b turned out to be the same rule as the service bay's light
> fixture, so `.bay-batten` serves both and is mounted on the public nav and the dashboard
> nav — one accent edge per screen.
>
> 2c is `.machined`, and it applies to **two** surfaces rather than many. The spec says
> stat wells over `--surface-3`; this app has no population of those — dashboard stats are
> bare flex columns, and HealthSummary's panels are tinted washes where a white catch-light
> would muddy the tint. The primitive is in the system for the next well that appears.
>
> The ignition sweep is in the gauge, 0 → 100 → settle over ~900ms, reduced-motion aware.

- **2b:** the nav's bottom edge carries a single 1px luminous cyan hairline (gradient fading at both ends, soft 10px glow) — the one place glow lives on chrome; one per screen, same discipline as the serif rule.
- **2c:** stat wells take a machined top edge — 1px catch-light + ~30px gradient falloff over `--surface-3`; everything else stays matte; no glassmorphism, no new tokens.
- **Ignition sweep:** on dashboard load, once per session — needle sweeps 0 → 100 → settles on the score in ~900ms (ease-out return), arc draws in behind it, count-up in sync. Complements the scan line (scan = photo band, sweep = gauge; never both on one element). `prefers-reduced-motion` jumps to the settled state. Hooks exist in `use-count-up.ts` and the intro gate. (~half day total)

### 10. DEMO_IMAGES + migration deleted together (F8)
> **DONE — 2 Aug 2026, and the item's premise was inverted.**
>
> Closed by asking the database instead of the migration file. All three demo rows hold
> local paths — `/vehicles/{accord,wrx,m3}/hero-3x2.jpg` — and no Pexels URL survives in
> the column, so the migration has been applied everywhere. That was the condition the map
> was always waiting on. Reverting the migration, as this item asked, would have *restored*
> the Pexels URLs rather than cleared them.
>
> The real constraint was the map's own warning: do not simply fall back to `image_url`,
> because the column holds the page-width hero. `packages/core/src/photo-slots.ts` derives
> `card-800` from `hero-3x2` and `VehicleIdentity` applies it for the card variant only —
> the naming convention the map itself proposed, and the one the AVIF/WebP siblings already
> use. A rule rather than a table, because a table has to be kept in step with the seed
> data and a rule cannot drift from it.
>
> Verified in the browser: the grid requests two `card-800` AVIFs and no hero; the dashboard
> band requests the hero and no card. Both budget suites now exercise the shipped derivation
> rather than importing a constant.

### 11. Blur-layer derivative (F7, optional)
> **DONE**, and no longer optional — it shipped as part of item 16. The fill takes a 32px
> inlined WebP (`packages/core/src/vehicle-blur.ts`, generated), so the full-size file is
> decoded once instead of twice. Whole placeholder set costs 3 KB.

- `VehicleIdentity` decodes the same source twice (blur fill + sharp contain). Acceptable once P1 item 4 lands; optionally feed the blur layer a tiny (~64px) derivative. Fully closed by P4 item 15.

---

## P3 — next quarter: system coherence

### 12. Own the vehicle photography
> **OPEN.** Needs a photographer and a budget — not code. Unblocks item 18.
>
> **Related and newly discovered:** `photography/build_assets.py`, which this item and item
> 4 both reference, **has never been committed**. Not in the working tree, absent from
> `git log --all --diff-filter=A`, and not in `.gitignore`. `public/vehicles/CREDITS.md`
> had been instructing readers to run it, which is how the audit reached a wrong conclusion
> in good faith. That section now says so. The practical cost: the crop anchors and focal-Y
> values behind the existing derivatives exist **only inside the committed JPEGs**. If that
> script is on David's machine, committing it is worth doing before any re-shoot.

- One commissioned session for the three demo cars. Fixes both documented content errors — the Accord is an 8th-generation car standing in for the seeded 2018 tenth-gen Sport 2.0T (and its hard-orange sunset violates the photography spec), and the "M3" may be an F30 with M-Sport package rather than an F80 — and clears the trademark caveat (recognisable marques in store marketing) blocking App Store captures. Full assignment of rights; masters into `photography/masters/`, derivatives regenerated via `build_assets.py`, provenance recorded in `public/vehicles/CREDITS.md` as with the Pexels set.
- Fallback if a shoot doesn't happen: re-source correct-generation cars via the existing Pexels workflow (photographer + URL recorded before the file enters the repo; dark/neutral light, no people, no plates, no signage) — but the trademark caveat then still needs a decision before store assets.

### 13. Make garage and dashboard rhyme
> **PARTIAL.** The 1c beltline shipped — `.cockpit-belt` on the dashboard, so the public
> garage (1a) and the dashboard now share one environmental language.
>
> **Still open:** promoting the cluster kit into the design system and `tokens.json` for
> the React Native build, and updating the DS specs that still describe the donut. That is
> a different repo and was not touchable from here.

- Dashboard adopts the **1c** beltline backdrop (brushed-metal band + one ambient strip) so the public garage (1a) and the dashboard share one environmental language.
- The cluster kit — dial (2a), band scale with 40/60/80 ticks, ignition sweep — is promoted into the design system as real components and into `tokens.json`, so the React Native build inherits the cockpit language rather than re-deriving it. Update the DS specs that still describe the donut.

### 14. Onboarding template
> **OPEN.** Real design work on the first screen a paying user meets; not something to
> improvise at the end of a session.

- The design system's own flagged gap: no template exists for onboarding (or invoice scan, or maintenance history). Onboarding is the first screen a paying user meets and the last one still designed ad hoc — build it from the same tokens before the App Store push, with the cluster/plate language applied from the start.

---

## P4 — pre-launch: hardening & proof

### 15. Budgets in CI, not vigilance
> **PARTIAL.** The image-weight half shipped as `lib/__tests__/image-weight-budget.test.ts`
> (the promote gate already runs `npx jest`): auth surfaces and `/` must ship no raster
> file, the grid stays under 250 KB *as delivered in AVIF*, every JPEG must have both
> derivatives, and the AVIF/JPEG ratio must stay above 2 — which is how a silently missing
> `.avif` gets caught, since the delivered measure falls back to the JPEG.
>
> The promote gate also gained a share-card step: og:image must be present, absolute https,
> not localhost, and return `image/*` from the candidate's own origin. That is F1's guard,
> and it has to live in the gate rather than a unit test because `metadataBase` resolves at
> render time — a green local build proves nothing about what Netlify serves.
>
> **Still open: LCP and CLS.** They need a real browser against a deployed URL, which is
> slow and flaky on a cold Netlify function, and a red build from a noisy metric teaches
> people to re-run until green. Lighthouse CI is the right tool; it needs an owner for its
> flake budget.

- LCP and CLS thresholds plus a per-page image-weight budget, checked on every Netlify deploy preview (Lighthouse CI or equivalent), so an F2/F3-class regression can never ship silently again. The promote gate already exists and already reads build-time env — give it these numbers as a second criterion.

### 16. Finish the media pipeline
> **DONE**, except `srcset`, which was considered and declined with a reason. The three
> slots already resolve to purpose-built derivatives — `card-800` for a ~400px card,
> `hero-3x2` for the band — so the slot *is* the breakpoint, and at 800px against a 400px
> card the source is already 2x. Adding 1x variants would serve only non-retina displays,
> for twelve more committed files, after AVIF has taken the set down 73%. Revisit if the
> budgets ever say otherwise.
>
> `fetchpriority="high"` and the inlined blur-up both shipped; F7 is closed.

- `srcset` breakpoints for the card/detail/hero slots; `fetchpriority="high"` on the LCP image per page; a tiny inline (~64px, base64) blur-up derivative feeding `VehicleIdentity`'s fill layer — instant paint under the sharp copy, and F7's double decode of the full-size file is gone.

### 17. Accessibility pass on the new visuals
> **DONE**, all three parts, and the audit found two live bugs.
>
> **Contrast:** measured against the lightest pixel the plate produces, `rgb(31,29,26)`.
> White text at 50% alpha and above passes AA for normal text (5.13:1) — the plate is not
> the constraint. Below that it fails: 40% is 3.78:1, 30% is 2.71:1. Those alphas are
> app-wide tokens that predate this work and appear on surfaces the plate never touches, so
> raising them is a design-token decision, **reported not taken**. Worth a call with Design.
>
> **Reduced motion:** the three motions this item names were already fine. The audit found
> two that were not — `TCOCard` drew its ring over 1200ms through a `requestAnimationFrame`
> loop with no check at all (CSS cannot see rAF), and `ConsultantChat` scrolled with
> `behavior: 'smooth'`, which is *specified to override* the `scroll-behavior` the blanket
> rule sets. Both fixed. The list is now `lib/__tests__/reduced-motion.test.ts` rather than
> a list, because a list read once is per-feature memory with extra steps.
>
> **Forced colors:** the app had **zero** handling anywhere. That mode overrides SVG
> `fill`/`stroke`, so the gauge's track, arc, needle and ticks all collapsed to one colour —
> it did not break, it showed a full ring at every score. Re-stated in system colours
> (`Highlight` against `GrayText`) rather than opting out with `forced-color-adjust: none`.

- Contrast audit of text over the plates at their dimmest (auth variant) against WCAG AA;
- `prefers-reduced-motion` coverage verified across door intro, scan line, and ignition sweep as one audited list rather than per-feature memory;
- forced-colors / high-contrast mode on the gauge (ticks, needle, and band label must survive without color).

### 18. Store-capture production run
> **OPEN.** Depends on item 12 by definition.

- Marketing screenshots produced from the owned P3 photography, with the photography spec enforced (no sunset frames — the rule the current Accord breaks), plate-blur boxes applied, and the trademark posture decided and recorded. Captures reproducible from a script, same convention as `build_assets.py`.

---

## Sequencing logic
P0 removes the two user-visible embarrassments on the highest-traffic paths and retires the licence risk. P1 makes every remaining image cheap and kills the unlicensed acquisition path. P2 is polish that needs P1's pieces. P3 spends real money (photography) only after the system it feeds is coherent. P4 locks the results in with automated proof before the App Store push.

---

# Work stream B — responsive web (R1–R15)

Source: `Responsive Audit.dc.html`, 2 Aug 2026, read against `main`. Every route checked at 320 / 375 / 414 / 768 / 1024 / 1440. Line numbers are as-read on `main` — re-locate by the quoted class string, not the number, if the file has moved since.

**The diagnosis, in one line:** the app is not unresponsive, it is desktop-authored and reflowed by accident. There are **18 breakpoint decisions in ~5,300 lines** of the screens users actually spend time in; four screens have zero. The mobile work that *does* exist (drawer, edge-fade tab strip, `.tap-target-44`, `@media (hover: none)`) is all correct and all applied to exactly the one element that reported the bug.

**Do RB0 first.** Fifteen patches without the shared rules produces a sixteenth finding next month, and most of R1–R15 collapse into one-line edits once the rules exist.

## RB0 — the four rules to adopt before the patches
> **DONE — 2 Aug 2026.** All four written into `app/globals.css` by name so reviews can
> cite them. Rules 3 and 4 are enforced in CSS there; rules 1 (the ladder) and 2 (the
> container scale) are conventions the markup carries, and RP1 is the pass that applies them.


Add to `app/globals.css` and to the DS spec, then reference by name in review.

1. **The ladder** — four widths, named by what changes, not by device:
   `base` one column / 16px gutter · `sm 640` two-up cards, full chrome · `lg 1024` three-up, sidebars appear · `2xl 1536` four-up, wider shell. `md` is a transition, not a design target — nothing may *first* appear at `md`.
2. **The container scale** — every nesting level steps down exactly once below `sm`:
   page `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-12` · panel `p-4 sm:p-6` · card `p-4 sm:p-5` · tile `p-3 sm:p-4`.
3. **Three floors**, lintable: **16px** any focusable input at ≤640 · **12px** any rendered text · **44px** any interactive target.
4. **Touch parity** — a control revealed by hover must have a non-hover path. One utility (`.reveal-on-hover`), and never `display:none` on an action.

---

## RP0 — this week (~1 day, all four are edits to shared code)

### R2. Every text field zooms the page on iOS and never zooms back — CRITICAL
> **DONE.** Pointer-scoped exactly as specified. The composer's `text-sm` was removed at the
> call site rather than the rule marked `!important` — verified it now carries no size utility
> and resolves through `.field`. The "do not use `maximum-scale`" warning is written beside
> the rule in the stylesheet, not only here.

> Highest visible-impact-to-effort ratio in the whole audit. Do it first.

- **Problem:** mobile Safari zooms the viewport when a focused input is under 16px and does **not** restore scale on blur. `.field` is 14px (`globals.css:876`), `.field-sm` 13px (`:931`), and the chat composer passes `text-sm` as a utility (`ConsultantChat.tsx:975`). Tapping the composer, conversation search, a mileage edit or any onboarding field jerks the layout and leaves the user on a horizontally-scrolled page for the rest of the session.
- **Not the viewport meta.** Next emits `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`, which is correct and stays. And `globals.css:876` already **predicted this exact bug** and deferred the call ("16 has an argument… belongs to whoever wants it, not to a primitive refactor"). Design owns it now: **16px on touch pointers, 14px kept for mouse-driven desktop.**
- **Change:** scope to the pointer, not the width —
  ```css
  /* iOS Safari zooms any focused input under 16px and never restores scale.
   * Pointer-scoped so mouse-driven desktop keeps its 14px density: a 500px
   * desktop window has no zoom rule to satisfy, a 1024px tablet does. */
  @media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
    .field, .field-sm, textarea, select, input[type="text"],
    input[type="email"], input[type="number"], input[type="search"] { font-size: 16px; }
  }
  ```
  The chat `Textarea` needs its `text-sm` class **removed** (a utility beats a bare selector), not the rule marked `!important`.
- **Do NOT fix it with `maximum-scale=1` or `user-scalable=no`.** Both stop the zoom by disabling pinch-zoom entirely — fails WCAG 1.4.4 and undoes the accessibility work in item 17. The field scale is the fix.
- **Verify:** iOS Safari, or Chrome device emulation with touch emulation on — focus each field, confirm `visualViewport.scale` stays 1; then confirm pinch-zoom still works.
- **Effort:** 20 minutes.

### R1. Dialogs cannot scroll and touch both edges of the phone — CRITICAL
> **DONE.** Primitive fixed once; all six local `vh` overrides deleted. Measured at 375×812:
> 326px wide, 25px backdrop each side, `max-height: 690.2px` (85dvh), `overflow-y: auto`,
> 16px radius.

- **Problem:** `components/ui/dialog.tsx:41` is stock shadcn — `w-full max-w-lg`, −50% translate centring, `p-6`, **no `max-height`, no `overflow`**. Any dialog taller than the viewport overflows past the top *and* bottom with no way to reach either end: clipped, not scrolled. At 375px the panel is exactly 375px wide, flush to both edges, and `sm:rounded-lg` means square corners below 640px. **Ten** dialogs inherit it unguarded, including the two longest flows in the product (`DocumentUploadDialog:257`, `VehiclePhotoUploadDialog:245`). Six others set `max-h-[90vh]` locally — right instinct, wrong unit: `vh` is the *largest* viewport on iOS, so 90vh still runs under the URL bar.
- **Change:** in the primitive, once —
  ```diff
  - 'fixed left-[50%] top-[50%] z-50 grid w-full max-w-lg … p-6 … sm:rounded-lg'
  + 'fixed left-[50%] top-[50%] z-50 grid w-[calc(100%-2rem)] max-w-lg
  +  max-h-[85dvh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain … p-5 sm:p-6 rounded-2xl'
  ```
  Then **delete** the six local `max-h-[90vh]` / `[80vh]` overrides — the base handles it, and leaving them re-introduces the `vh` bug.
- **Verify:** open the document-upload dialog at 375×667 with a long form; both the title and the submit button must be reachable, and 16px of backdrop must show on each side.
- **Effort:** ~1 hour for all ten.

### R3. Vehicle-info spec tiles collapse to a column of single letters — CRITICAL
> **DONE.** Both sites. Measured at 375px: one column, 227px per tile, against the ~0 the
> text column used to resolve to.

- **Problem:** `app/vehicle-info/[vehicleId]/page.tsx:189` and `:234` are a bare `grid grid-cols-3` with no breakpoint. From the 231px a card gets at 375px (see R6): each column is 66px, of which a 32px icon, a 12px gap and 32px of tile padding are already spent. The text column resolves to ~0 and "8-speed automatic" wraps one character per line.
- **Change:** `- grid grid-cols-3 gap-4` → `+ grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-3 sm:gap-4`, both sites.
- **Effort:** 10 minutes.

### R5. Three controls a touch user can never reveal — CRITICAL
> **DONE.** `.reveal-on-hover` added and `.meta-edit` / `.turn-actions` now share its
> declarations. The named-group warning was real — the selector carries `.group\/image:hover`
> as well, or the card's photo overlay would have been missed. Verified: 18 controls, none
> still on a `group-hover` utility, all pinned under `(hover: none)`.

- **Problem:** `VehicleCard.tsx:316` (photo overlay), `:417` (⋮ menu) and `MaintenanceHistory.tsx:382` (delete record) are `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`. No hover on a phone, so **delete vehicle, change photo and update mileage have no mobile entry point at all** — and adding the photo the whole identity-plate design depends on is impossible from the garage.
- **Change:** the system already solved this — `.meta-edit` (`globals.css:828`) and `.turn-actions` (`:1019`) both pin visible under `@media (hover: none)`, with the reasoning written down. Generalise it instead of adding a third copy:
  ```css
  .reveal-on-hover { opacity: 0; transition: opacity var(--duration-fast); }
  .group:hover .reveal-on-hover,
  .reveal-on-hover:focus-visible { opacity: 1; }
  @media (hover: none) { .reveal-on-hover { opacity: 1; } }
  ```
  Retire `.meta-edit` and `.turn-actions` into it so the next hover affordance inherits the touch behaviour rather than re-deriving it. Note `VehicleCard` uses the named group `group/image` — keep the name or the selector misses.
- **Verify:** DevTools → Rendering → emulate `hover: none`; all three controls visible and tappable.
- **Effort:** 20 minutes.

## RP1 — next (~2 days, mechanical once RB0 exists; do it in one pass, not per screen)

> **DONE — 2 Aug 2026, afternoon (`8456afe`).** All four, in one pass as asked.
> Came in nearer two hours than two days, because RB0 had already done the
> deciding. Details on each below; two things were left undone deliberately and
> both say so.

### R6. No container in the chain gets smaller below `sm` — HIGH
> **DONE.** RB0 rule 2 across 7 page shells (`px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-12`) and 20
> panels (`p-4 sm:p-6`). Measured on the public garage: `main` padding 24px →
> 16px below `sm`, still 24px at and above it, no horizontal overflow at either.
>
> **The 199px → 271px claim is not re-verified.** That chain is on the
> dashboard, which is behind auth and could not be measured from a session with
> no credentials. The rule is applied everywhere the grep finds; the number is
> still the audit's, not a fresh measurement.
- **Problem:** four nested containers each take 24px a side and none steps down — `DashboardLayout.tsx:281` (`px-6 lg:px-12`), `:404` (`glass-panel p-6`), every `Card` (`p-6`), inner tiles (`p-4`). At 375px: **375 → 327 → 279 → 231 → 199**. 53% of the device is nested gutter. R3, R8 and R13 are all this finding wearing a different component.
- **Change:** apply RB0 rule 2 everywhere. 375px then yields **271px** of content instead of 199px (+36%).
- **Verify:** grep for `\bp-6\b` and `px-6` with no `sm:` sibling; the count should reach zero outside desktop-only blocks.
- **Effort:** ~2 hours.

### R9. The 44px utility exists and is used six times — HIGH
> **DONE.** Nav tabs → `py-3 min-h-[44px]` at 13px, which closes an R10 site in
> the same edit. Nine icon and pill controls gained `.tap-target-44`; adoption
> 12 → 22. The ⋮ vehicle menu was already fixed by RP0's R5 work.
>
> **One control deliberately did not get the utility, and the reason
> generalises.** The consultant's follow-up chips wrap at `gap-2`.
> `.tap-target-44` centres a 44px `::after` on its element, so on a ~30px chip
> it overhangs ~7px top and bottom — into an 8px gap, from both sides. Two rows
> of chips would have had *overlapping hit areas*, and the tap goes to whichever
> pseudo-element paints last. A control that answers the wrong tap is worse than
> one slightly too small, so those grew for real (`py-2.5 min-h-[44px]`).
>
> **Read the utility's docblock as binding:** "any small chip that is a real
> standalone tap target". A wrapped row is what that qualifier excludes, and it
> is worth checking before the next application.
>
> **Still open:** the lint rule. `_adherence.oxlintrc.json` is in the DS repo and
> was not touchable from here, so this is still a review comment rather than a
> check — the exact shape of decay this file keeps warning about.

- **Problem:** `.tap-target-44` (`globals.css:791`) is correct and barely adopted. The **primary navigation misses the floor**: tab links are `px-4 py-2.5 text-xs` ≈ 36px tall (`DashboardLayout.tsx:268`), on the one control every signed-in session touches. Also under 44px: ⋮ vehicle menu 32px (`VehicleCard.tsx:417`), performance refresh 32px (`vehicle-info:219`), maintenance delete 36px, chat "New" 28px, composer attach + send.
- **Change:** tabs → `px-4 py-3 text-[13px] min-h-[44px]` (visual weight unchanged, and it fixes an R10 site at the same time). Icon buttons → add `.tap-target-44`; it expands the hit area, not the glyph.
- **Then:** add it to the lint set — an interactive element under 44px with no `.tap-target-44` is a review comment, not a taste question. `_adherence.oxlintrc.json` in the DS is the place.
- **Effort:** ~2 hours.

### R10. Thirty uses of 10 and 11px type, none of them decorative — HIGH
> **DONE, to the 12px floor.** All of it to `text-xs`.
>
> **It was 54, not thirty** — across seventeen files, not five. The audit named
> the five worst (`ConsultantChat` ×12, `UpcomingMaintenance` ×10,
> `TierProgressCard` ×9, `CostBreakdownTable` ×5, `DemoBanner`) and those were
> right; the tail was twice as long. 54 is the number to carry forward.
>
> **Still open: the second half of the change line.** "Data and labels on mobile
> → 13px" is not a mechanical pass — it needs a judgement per site about what
> counts as data. Only the hard floor landed. `ClusterGauge`'s band label went
> to 12px with the rest and is worth a look on a card, since it is a verdict
> rendered in an abbreviated form to fit.

- **Problem:** `UpcomingMaintenance` ×10, `ConsultantChat` ×12, `CostBreakdownTable` ×5, `DemoBanner`, `TierProgressCard`. The DS's smallest token is `--text-body-xs: 12px`, so all of it is off-scale — and it carries due dates, cost estimates, conversation timestamps, table headers and the "Get Quote" action. At 10px on a dark surface at arm's length it is not quiet, it is unreadable, and it contradicts a brand voice where the numbers carry the argument.
- **Change:** `text-[10px]` / `text-[11px]` → `text-xs` (12px) as a hard floor; data and labels on mobile → 13px. **Contrast, not size, makes a label recede** — `text-muted-40` at 12px reads quieter than white at 10px and stays legible.
- **Effort:** ~2 hours.

### R15. One 600px-wide card at tablet width; three at 1440 — MEDIUM
> **DONE (`3dd9743`), and the change line as written was incomplete.**
>
> Measured before, at 700px: `grid-template-columns` computed to `none` — one
> card, exactly as described. After: two 314px cards on the live garage.
>
> **The `2xl` column needed the shell widened, which the change line does not
> say.** Adding `2xl:grid-cols-4` alone puts four columns inside `max-w-7xl`,
> which does not grow past 1280px — the cards come out ~290px, *narrower than
> the 338px the same card gets at 700px in two-up*. A fourth column that shrinks
> every card below its tablet size is a regression wearing a fix's clothes. RB0
> rule 1 already says the answer — "2xl 1536 four-up, **wider shell**" — so the
> two `<main>` elements take `2xl:max-w-[96rem]`. Measured at 1600: 1536px
> shell, four 342px cards.
>
> Scoped to the two routes' own `<main>`, not `DashboardLayout`'s container, so
> nothing else inherits a width change it was not audited for.
>
> Verified at four widths: 375 one column · 700 two · 1440 three, shell still
> 1280, no horizontal overflow · 1600 four.

- **Problem:** `app/page.tsx:158` (`gap-6`) and `app/garage/page.tsx:128` (`gap-8`) both run `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` and **skip `sm` entirely**, so 640–767px renders a single column of enormous cards — the worst-looking width in the product, and where a landscape phone and a small tablet both land. Above 1280px `max-w-7xl` caps the row at three, leaving gutters where a fourth column belongs. The two grids also disagree about their gap.
- **Change:** one grid, both routes — `grid gap-5 sm:gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 2xl:grid-cols-4`.
- **Effort:** 20 minutes.

## RP2 — after (~4 days; these need design, not a prefix)

### R4. The consultant is a fixed 520px box inside a scrolling page — CRITICAL
> Critical by impact, but scheduled here because it is a layout rebuild, not an edit.

- **Problem:** `ConsultantChat.tsx:609` is `h-[calc(100vh-320px)] min-h-[520px] max-h-[760px]`. On a 667px phone the calc yields 347px, so `min-h` wins and the panel is 520px — inside a page whose demo banner, nav, tab strip, vehicle title and meta row have already eaten ~400px. **The composer sits below the fold: you scroll the page to type and the thread to read.** Two scroll contexts stacked on the flagship feature. `100vh` also measures the URL-bar-collapsed viewport, so the panel exceeds the visible area on first paint.
- **Change:** below `md`, the consultant route becomes an app shell —
  ```
  shell    h-[100dvh] flex flex-col overflow-hidden
  thread   flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto
  composer shrink-0 pb-[env(safe-area-inset-bottom)]
  panel    h-auto md:h-[calc(100dvh-320px)] md:min-h-[520px] md:max-h-[760px]
  ```
  The page title, meta row and surrounding `glass-panel` padding should **not render** below `md` — a chat screen on a phone is chrome + thread + composer. Keep the existing drawer behaviour (`:621`) untouched; it is already right.
- **Verify:** 375×667 with the keyboard up — composer visible without page scroll, thread scrolls under it, no rubber-banding of the page behind.
- **Effort:** ~half a day.

### R8. A five-column cost table in 231px, inside `overflow-hidden` — HIGH
- **Problem:** `CostBreakdownTable.tsx:55–63` — Item · Parts · Labor Hrs · Labor Cost · Total, `text-[11px]` headers, every cell carrying a low *and* a high figure. The wrapper is `overflow-hidden`, so the usual escape hatch (let it scroll sideways) is actively closed. This is the artefact the consultant produces to justify an estimate — it *is* the answer — and on a phone it is a stack of clipped numerals.
- **Change:** a card per line item below `md`, the table above it. Same data, same order, no horizontal scroll:
  ```
  Brake pads & rotors, front          ← description, 15px
  Parts     $180 – $240               ← label/value rows, right-aligned .num
  Labor     2.0 – 2.5 hr · $260
  Total     $440 – $500               ← band-weighted
  ```
  Keep `<table>` at `md`+ where the column scan is the point. Do not "fix" this by removing `overflow-hidden` — a sideways-scrolling estimate is not an answer either.
- **Effort:** ~3 hours.

### R11. A 36px page title over a four-up meta row — MEDIUM
- **Problem:** `DashboardLayout.tsx:296` is `text-4xl lg:text-5xl`, so a phone gets 36px for "2018 Honda Accord" in 279px — three lines before the trim appears. `:303` puts Mileage / Avg monthly / Status / Reliability in `flex flex-wrap gap-8`, which wraps to a ragged 2 + 2 with 32px gutters.
- **Change:** `h1` → `text-2xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl`; meta row → `grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 gap-y-5 sm:flex sm:flex-wrap sm:gap-8`.
- **Effort:** ~1 hour.

### R12. The breadcrumb — and with it the way back — is hidden below 640px — MEDIUM
- **Problem:** `DashboardLayout.tsx:236` is `hidden sm:flex`. Garage › vehicle › page plus the scrolled health-score pill all vanish on a phone; what remains is a logo that happens to be a link. The comment above it records that four separate routes back to the garage were consolidated into this one control — which is then `display:none` on the viewport where a back affordance matters most.
- **Change:** below `sm`, one row — `‹ Garage · Accord · 61` (chevron-left + parent + short name + score pill, `min-h-[44px]`). Full breadcrumb returns at `sm`.
- **Effort:** ~1 hour.

### R13. Service rows drop the date and truncate the job — MEDIUM
> **INVALID AS WRITTEN — `components/MaintenanceHistory.tsx` is not rendered
> anywhere.** Nothing imports it: no `<MaintenanceHistory`, no import of
> `@/components/MaintenanceHistory` or `./MaintenanceHistory`, no
> `dynamic()`/`lazy()` reference, in `app/` or `components/`. It exports a
> default that no file consumes. The only mention left in the tree is a comment
> in `CollapsibleSection.tsx`.
>
> **And the live page does not have this defect.**
> `app/documents/[vehicleId]/page.tsx` renders the service history itself and
> contains no `hidden sm:`, no `truncate` and no date formatting at all — the
> date is printed plainly, which is the thing R13 asks for.
>
> The fix was written and then reverted rather than committed. Editing a
> component nothing renders is work that looks like progress, cannot be
> verified by any flow, and would leave the file looking maintained.
>
> **This is item 12's failure again, one layer over.** That entry records
> `photography/build_assets.py` as "never committed… which is how the audit
> reached a wrong conclusion in good faith". Same shape: the audit read source
> and inferred that reading it meant it ran.
>
> **David's call, and it is a scope decision rather than a fix:** delete
> `MaintenanceHistory.tsx` and `UpcomingMaintenance.tsx`, or wire them up if
> they were meant to be reached. R13 and R14 only become real after that.
>
> **Taken for `UpcomingMaintenance.tsx` — deleted, see R14.** This file is the
> one left, and the decision is still open on it.
- **Problem:** `MaintenanceHistory.tsx:347–376` keeps one line and pays for it — date `hidden sm:flex`, part number `hidden sm:inline`, description `truncate`, beside a category badge and a right-aligned cost. A maintenance record with its date hidden has the second-most-important fact removed, on the screen whose whole job is "what was done, when, for how much."
- **Change:** two lines below `sm`, one line above —
  ```
  Front brake pads & rotors              $486.20
  Ken's Auto · 14 Mar 2026 · Brakes
  ```
- **Effort:** ~2 hours.

### R14. A 260px carousel that fits neither phone nor desktop — MEDIUM
> **CLOSED BY DELETION — `components/UpcomingMaintenance.tsx` is gone.** The
> item was invalid as written: the component was not rendered anywhere either.
> Same evidence as R13, and the claim that it "is the only horizontally-
> scrolling region in the app" was the tell — the only live `overflow-x-auto` in
> `app/` or `components/` outside it are the dashboard's tab strip, which carries
> `edge-fade-x` deliberately, and `EmailDraftDisplay`. There was no carousel on
> any screen a user could reach.
>
> A fix was written and reverted first, for the reason under R13. The decision
> that entry asked for has now been taken in the delete direction: the component
> and `LogServiceModal.tsx`, its only child and the sole reason that file
> existed, are both removed. `packages/core/src/service-due.ts` already replaces
> the approach — it reads the vehicle's own schedule rather than the hardcoded
> `COMMON_INTERVALS` table this component carried, which is the argument for
> deleting rather than wiring up.
>
> **`MaintenanceHistory.tsx` is still there**, so R13 is still open on the same
> terms.
- **Problem:** `UpcomingMaintenance.tsx:136`, `:415` — fixed `w-[260px]` cards in a snap scroller. At 375px that leaves a 19px sliver of the next card: too little to read as "more," too much to read as an edge. At 1440px the same strip scrolls through four items while 600px of row sits empty. It is the only horizontally-scrolling region in the app and it scrolls at *every* width.
- **Change:** below `sm` → `w-[78vw] max-w-[300px] snap-start` (a legible next-card peek); `md`+ → `grid grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`, no scroller.
- **Effort:** ~1 hour.

---

## RP3 — with onboarding (~1 day) — folds into item 14

### R7. Onboarding has no responsive markup at all — HIGH
- **Problem:** `components/OnboardingWizard.tsx` — **856 lines, zero breakpoints**, the least responsive file in the repo and the first screen a paying user meets. The step rail (`:50`) sets five 32px circles with `text-[10px] whitespace-nowrap` labels beneath; "Powertrain" and "Performance" are wider than their circles, so below ~420px the labels overlap. Year/Make is `grid-cols-2` (`:438`); mileage presets are `grid-cols-4` (`:586`) — four ~60px buttons carrying four-digit numbers.
- **Change:** do **not** add prefixes to 856 lines. Build it from the DS onboarding template (item 14 / the DS's own flagged gap) with these decisions baked in:
  ```
  rail     below sm → "Step 3 of 5 · Mileage" + a 2px progress bar
           the dotted rail is a desktop affordance, not a small one
  fields   grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2
  presets  grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4, min-h-[44px]
  actions  full-width stacked buttons below sm
  ```
- **Dependency:** merge this item with item 14 rather than tracking both. Closing 14 closes R7.
- **Effort:** ~1 day (inside item 14's estimate).

---

## RP4 — pre-launch (~half a day) — extends item 15

### A viewport matrix in CI, beside the LCP/CLS budgets
- 320 · 375 · 768 · 1440, asserting: **no horizontal overflow** (`scrollWidth <= clientWidth` on `body`), **no interactive target under 44px**, **no rendered text under 12px**, **no focusable input under 16px at ≤640**. Static analysis covers the last two cheaply — the same pattern as `image-weight-budget.test.ts`, and it registers in `STATIC_ANALYSIS_SUITES` the same way. The first two need a real browser, so they ride with item 15's Lighthouse CI owner.
- Then this audit cannot happen twice.

## Already right — do not regress these

Nine deliberate pieces of responsive work are already in the codebase. The recommendation above is to **generalise** them, not replace them.

| What | Why it is right | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Consultant sidebar → drawer | Reclaims 256px of a 375px viewport; overlay + handle, static at `md` | `ConsultantChat:621` |
| Scrollable tab strip + edge fade | Mask scoped to ≤640 so desktop tabs are not dimmed for nothing | `globals.css:1069` |
| One tab strip, not two | Duplicate nav deleted rather than timed around | `DashboardLayout:261` |
| `.tap-target-44` | Expands hit area without inflating the glyph | `globals.css:791` |
| `@media (hover: none)` | Applied to `.meta-edit` / `.turn-actions`, reasoning written down | `globals.css:828`, `:1019` |
| Photo hero reworked at ≤640 | Contain-not-crop, blur fill, tint dropped, content inset to 18px | `globals.css:691` |
| Service visit rows | Genuine `flex-col md:flex-row` — the pattern the rest should copy | `documents:238` |
| Collapsible dashboard sections | Folded sections with summaries — right answer to a long mobile page | `dashboard:166` |
| Reduced-motion + forced-colors | Honoured at the token layer, ahead of most products this size | `globals.css:307`, `:1391` |

---

## Breakpoint matrix as found

**Broken** = a task cannot be completed. **Degraded** = completable, visibly wrong.

# Handoff — 2 Aug 2026, night (final session)

**Read this one.** Two earlier handoffs are kept below — the ~19:38 "end of day"
entry, which was written before this session and is now superseded on state, and
the morning's, kept for its gotchas. Neither "what I would pick up first" list is
current.

## Where things stand

- `main` = `6e1d727`, working tree clean. **Two commits are unpromoted**:
  `1cb0d31` (2.98) and `6e1d727` (traffic-class split).
- Production serves `e7f14df7` = `main @ 1ec6e68`, promoted 19:33 through the
  full scripted gate. **Verified from the artifact, not the report**: `--no-ff`
  merge with parents `f09a0ef6` and `1ec6e68b`, subject byte-identical to
  `promote-demo.mjs`'s own format, and — the load-bearing part — **an empty
  body**, where a waived AI gate would have written `AI GATE WAIVED with
  --allow-degraded-ai`. So the consultant round-trip ran and passed.
- **64 suites, 1110 tests, green.** `npm run typecheck` clean. `npm run build`
  clean, all routes compiled.
- Two stale worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`, both behind `main` with nothing
  ahead. Prunable.

## ⚠ David's list — one migration is time-sensitive

1. **Apply `20260802200000_split_ai_usage_by_traffic_class.sql`.** Pure
   additions, no `DROP`, so the SQL Editor will not stall. **Every metering row
   written before it runs is blended permanently** — no later migration can
   reconstruct which traffic was demo, real, or the canary. This is the one item
   that gets worse by waiting.
2. **`brew install cocoapods`** — unblocks the simulator and the rest of Phase 3.
3. **A dashboard read for erratum T2**, blocking 5.2:
   `select tablename, policyname, cmd, roles, qual from pg_policies order by tablename;`
4. **Review the KB queue** — `cd ~/Developer/advisor-kb && node dist/cli.js queue`.

*The `ai_usage_events` migration is **already applied** — recording since
2 Aug 21:09Z, and schema-verified in the ~19:38 handoff below. It was still
listed as outstanding in the ~14:30 handoff and in Rev. E when this session
started, which is why item 1 above is worth reading carefully rather than
pattern-matching to "the migration is done".*

## What landed this session

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `1cb0d31` | **2.98a/c/d** — the quote pull, its instrumentation, and V1 deleted |
| `6e1d727` | **Traffic-class split** on `ai_usage_events` — `surface`, and the canary out of the price dataset |

Documents, outside the repo: the full 2 Aug day landed in `CREWCHIEF_STATUS.md`;
Rev. E's state table corrected and errata T1/T2 applied; ten KB proposals staged
(`p-20260802194500-rev5`, queue 1/25); `CREWCHIEF_FEATURES.md` corrected.

## The finding worth carrying: an average across two populations measures neither

The first eight metering rows read 583 visible tokens against 2,012 thinking —
**3.45×**, after 2.95a had set a thinking level. I published that number in
`CREWCHIEF_STATUS.md` as "thinking is running 3.45× the visible answer, after
2.95a", and it was read — reasonably — as evidence that 2.95a had only half
landed and that D2's clock was running on a half-fixed system.

It had fully landed. Grouped by purpose:

```
health_check (canary)   5 rows    40 visible/call   296 thinking/call   7.34x
consultant (real)       3 rows   127 visible/call   177 thinking/call   1.39x
── blended ──           8 rows                                          3.45x
```

**Real traffic was at 1.39× the whole time**, essentially the target. The canary
asks a fixed question and gets a ~40-token answer while thinking is roughly a
fixed cost per call, so its ratio is a property of the probe rather than of the
model — and it was 5 of the 8 rows, so it dominated.

Three things generalise from this:

1. **A ratio metric is unsafe on short-answer paths.** Thinking-per-call is the
   stable number; thinking-to-visible is not, because the denominator moves for
   reasons that have nothing to do with cost.
2. **Never aggregate a synthetic probe with real traffic.** That is what the
   `surface` column now prevents structurally, rather than by remembering.
3. **I reported an aggregate without checking whether it was one population.**
   The check took one query. The cost of not doing it was a day of the roadmap
   carrying "2.95a may have only half-landed" as an open risk.

## The real 2.95a gap, which is smaller and different

**The level shipped is `LOW`, not `MINIMAL`** — six of the seven `withThinking`
call sites (only the lite-model classifier at `app/actions.ts:776` uses
`MINIMAL`). So the ~73.6% reduction anyone expected was for a setting the code
does not use.

The bench in the previous session measured, on the same prompt:

```
unset 861  ·  HIGH 726  ·  LOW 424  ·  MINIMAL 0
```

So **`LOW` cuts ~51% against unset, and `MINIMAL` cuts 100% — zero thinking
tokens.** The economics document's 73.6% figure matches neither and is cited
there as *reported* rather than measured; the bench is the better source and the
doc should be corrected to it.

**`LOW → MINIMAL` is a real remaining lever, but it is a quality decision, not a
cost one.** Zero thinking tokens on the consultant may or may not survive the
round-trip gate, and eight rows is not a basis for deciding. Vision is already
deliberately left with no level at all, for the documented reason that a
regression there is invisible — fewer line items still returns valid JSON and
still passes every gate.

## Gotchas this session added

1. **`purpose` and `surface` are orthogonal and it is worth keeping them so.**
   `purpose` says which *feature* spent the money; `surface` says whose traffic
   it was. The instruction that produced this work said "add a `purpose` column",
   but `purpose` already existed and answers the other question. A consultant
   call can be demo, real or anonymous, costs the same to serve, and means three
   different things to a price.
2. **`surface` defaults to `account`, deliberately.** A future call site that
   has not been taught about the column lands in the bucket that *counts* toward
   cost. Over-counting a price input is visible and recoverable; under-counting
   it produces a confident, cheap, wrong number.
3. **The derivation order in `deriveSurface` is load-bearing and tested.** A
   signed-in user browsing the demo garage is still an `account` — their calls
   cost real money against a real person who might pay. Reversing the `userId`
   and demo-vehicle checks would quietly move real spend into an excluded
   bucket.
4. **`generateQuoteRequestV2` takes wishlist ids**, so the consultant pull can
   only offer items that were actually added. Items without an id are filtered
   rather than sent, which is why the affordance can disappear again after an
   add. Both add outcomes carry an id — 201 returns the row, 409 returns
   `itemId` — and the 409 is a normal path, because the dossier and the
   consultant suggest the same job.
5. **A preselection effect keyed on an array re-runs forever.** Callers build
   `preselectedItemIds` inline, so it is a new identity every render; keying the
   effect on it stamps the preselection back over the user's own tick-boxes
   while the dialog sits open. It is keyed on the joined string instead, and the
   fourth test in `quote-pull-preselection.test.ts` is what catches that being
   undone.
6. **There is no analytics product in this application.** No PostHog, no
   Plausible, no event pipeline — only the structured logger. This matters
   beyond 2.98c: the roadmap makes funnel instrumentation a **ship gate** for
   the anonymous front door, and that substrate does not exist. Now sized at
   0.75 ed, and **the cost is anonymous visitor correlation**, which also does
   not exist — `checkRateLimit` takes a caller-supplied string, not an IP or a
   cookie. Four events without a join key are four counters, not a funnel.

## Two documents that were wrong, and how they got that way

**`CREWCHIEF_FEATURES.md` claimed a capability that does not exist.** *Service
items and costs* pitched "compare that against what you were quoted" — there is
no stored quoted figure anywhere in the schema, and `estimateCosts` has exactly
one caller, inside `generateQuoteRequestV2`. **That sentence is where roadmap
task 2.98b came from.** The claim did not merely misdescribe the product; it was
read as a specification and produced a task that was costed, sequenced and
partially planned before anyone checked the tree. It is the second false
capability claim found in that file.

An audit of the whole file — 109 symbols named in `how:`/`pitch:` lines, checked
against the tree — found **no third false capability claim**, but **ten stale
`lib/` paths** left over from the Phase 2.4 move into `@crewchief/core`.
`lib/onboarding.ts` was among them, and the knowledge base corrected exactly that
path on 28 July: the fix reached the KB and never reached the features file. All
ten now resolve.

**A build-time guard does not generalise, for a structural reason.** The obvious
model is `provenance-claims.test.ts`, which fails the build if the app renders an
unsubstantiated provenance badge. It cannot be copied here: `CREWCHIEF_FEATURES.md`
is not in the repository, and `FeaturesDrawer.tsx` carries none of the pitch copy,
so the build cannot see the artifact. Making it a *test* means moving the file
into the repo first — a real decision, since it is the document sent to other
people.

So it is a script instead, alongside `audit-rls.mjs`, which is not in CI for the
same class of reason:

```
node scripts/audit-feature-claims.mjs
```

**It catches drift, not falsehood**, and says so on every clean run. Neither of
the two false capability claims would have failed it. Three things it learned the
hard way, all recorded in its own comments:

- **A path-like symbol is a claim about the filesystem, not about source text.**
  Grepping file *contents* for `packages/core/src/prompts.ts` always misses; the
  first run reported six false negatives on paths that were perfectly correct.
- **A "not a real path" category will swallow a real reference if you let it.**
  An earlier version matched URLs on "has dots" and quietly absorbed
  `storage-paths.test.ts`. Source extensions now win over every category.
- **An `internal:` note legitimately names things that are gone.**
  `uploadInvoiceForCompletion` "used to write `invoices/{file}`" is a correct
  sentence about a path that must *not* exist. Symbols that fail to resolve on a
  line narrating a change are reported as historical rather than stale — printed,
  never dropped, because that heuristic could in principle hide a real defect.

## Still open, in priority order

1. **Erratum T2** — blocks 5.2. The anon RLS audit run this session found no
   non-demo rows reachable across 25 tables, and `vehicle-documents` is private.
   **That evidence does not touch the actual question**, which is what an
   *authenticated* caller whose subscription lapsed can reach. Do not let anyone
   close T2 on the anon result.
2. **Phase 3 stays at ~16 remaining.** Built is not proven, and the simulator has
   never run. **The blocker was never `xcode-select`** — that diagnosis was
   wrong twice. `apps/mobile/ios` has never been generated (gitignored at
   `apps/mobile/.gitignore:40`, no DerivedData, nothing installed on the booted
   device) and CocoaPods is not installed. Do not run the simulator tool's
   suggested `sudo xcode-select -s`; it is already the current selection.
3. **2.98b is undecided, not dropped.** Recommendation is to drop it; three
   costed options are in the roadmap's §3.3.
4. **`LOW → MINIMAL`** on the non-prose paths, once the round-trip gate can
   speak to quality.
5. **5.1's remaining half** — the upgrade-prompt UI, still deliberately unbuilt
   while D2 and D3 are open.

# Handoff — 2 Aug 2026, ~19:38 (evening session, superseded on state)

**Superseded by the entry above**, which was written after two more commits
landed. Its "where things stand" is accurate as of 19:38 and wrong now in three
specific ways, all corrected above: `main` has moved to `6e1d727`, the test
count is 64/1110, and **two commits are unpromoted** rather than none.

Kept in full because everything else in it holds: the promote verification, the
afternoon's commit table, its schema check on the applied metering migration,
and its gotchas.

## Where things stand

- `main` = `1ec6e68`, pushed. Working tree clean.
- **Production serves `e7f14df7`**, promoted from `main @ 1ec6e68` through the
  full gate. `verify-demo.mjs` green against prod afterwards, two standing
  warnings. **Everything in this document is live** — nothing is sitting
  unpromoted.
- 62 suites, 1090 tests, green. `npm run typecheck` clean.
- **Two stale worktrees** under `.claude/worktrees/` (`confident-shtern`,
  `friendly-lewin`). Both are *behind* `main` with nothing ahead — checked, no
  stranded work. Prunable whenever.

### Verified on prod after the promote, not just locally

- `/dashboard` — 44 rendered text nodes, **0 failing WCAG AA**
- `/` at 375 — horizontal overflow 0, `textUnder12px` 0
- `/` at 700 — two 314px columns (was one 652px column)
- `/consultant` at 375 — composer on screen, thread scrolling, no overflow
- demo consultant answered anonymously through the new cap, and the meter
  recorded it — the first `purpose: 'consultant'` row in `ai_usage_events`

## What landed this afternoon

Eighteen commits across three tracks — design, cost, and mobile. The design
track was the visible half; the cost track is the one that changes the unit
economics.

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `92f56e2` | **2.95b** — invoices are reduced before the extractor sees them |
| `3dd9743` | **R15** — two-up at `sm`, and a wider shell at `2xl` |
| `b5d1c53` | **2.95a** — an explicit thinking level, and the gate that proves it |
| `02c78cf` | A return-type fix, and a correction to `b5d1c53`'s own claim |
| `8456afe` | **RP1** — R6, R9, R10 in one pass |
| `bb83782` | **2.95c** — every Gemini call metered, per account |
| `4947512` | **R4** + **NEW-01** — consultant app shell; banner stops widening the page |
| `2a315cc` | **NEW-02** — the closed garage door is inert, not just opaque |
| `fec351b` | **NEW-04** — last four hover-only reveals, plus a build check |
| `9b8cf8f` | **NEW-03** — QA script corrected against the tree it will next be run on |
| `1a691e7` | **R8** — cost breakdown becomes cards below `md` |
| `680b5a9` | **R11 + R12** — phone-sized title, and the way back |
| `7aa60a6` | **R13/R14 invalid** — both target components nothing renders |
| `0fe7248` | **5.1** — a monthly ceiling on AI spend, per account |
| `7f1f0ce` | **Phase 3.3** — account deletion reachable in-app (Apple 5.1.1(v)) |
| `d756780` | **Demo cap** — two windows, one pool, degrades rather than breaks |
| `47af5c4` | Stored photo size bounded server-side |
| `1ec6e68` | **Item 17** — body text raised to the AA floor, measured |

## Cowork's QA report — triaged

**Read this before acting on that report: it was run against `main 7630d42`,
which predates every commit in the table above.** Its jest count (979/979, 57
suites) is the morning tree; this one is 1035/59.

| Finding | State |
|---|---|
| R9, R10, R15 "reproduce exactly as described" | **Already closed here** by `8456afe` and `3dd9743`. True of that tree, not this one |
| **NEW-01** banner overflows at 320/360/375 | **Fixed** (`4947512`). Verified 0 overflow at 320 |
| **NEW-02** focus enters the garage behind the closed door | **Fixed** (`2a315cc`) |
| **NEW-03** B2 fails as written | **Closed** (`9b8cf8f`). Cowork was right that the check is the defect: the field computes 16px because `input[type='text']` at (0,1,1) outranks `.text-xs` at (0,1,0). B2 now asserts computed size |
| **NEW-04** four hover-only reveals never migrated | **Closed** (`fec351b`), and B8 with it — that grep is now `touch-parity.test.ts` and the build runs it |

**All four are closed.** `docs/qa-script.md` has been corrected in the same
pass: its §0 now separates open from closed-on-main, its §2 baseline is marked
stale wholesale with the three wrong cells named, and the header says to run
against the candidate rather than prod until a promote happens.

**One correction to fold back into `docs/qa-script.md`:** its §2 baseline records
`/` @375 `horizontalOverflow: false`, and that cell was wrong when written —
NEW-01 was present at the time, and the same row's `textUnder12px: 1` *is* that
banner's link. The other two baseline deltas Cowork lists (25 vs 16 sub-44px
targets, 346 vs 348px grid) are theirs to re-derive.

**And a finding against my own work, worth keeping:** RP1's 12px type floor made
NEW-01 *worse* before it was fixed. Cowork measured the overflowing link at
126px against `text-[10px]`; at `text-xs` it is 147px, so the 4px overflow it
reported at 375 would have become ~14px. The floor was right and stays. Two
correct rules can still collide, and the collision showed up in a QA run rather
than in either change.

### The two findings worth carrying, whatever you pick up next

**1. The consultant health check was testing the wrong model.**
`/api/health/consultant` hardcoded `'gemini-2.5-flash'` while the consultant ran
`FLASH_MODEL` (3.6). The canary answered "is some model reachable" while
reporting "is the consultant working" — it would have stayed green straight
through a 3.6 outage. Fixed in `b5d1c53`, and `ai-thinking-level.test.ts` now
fails the build if a literal comes back. **This is the `cc-product-0003` lesson
landing on an instrument, and it is the third time.**

**2. A thinking level is a 400, not a hint.** Sending one to a 2.5 model returns
`INVALID_ARGUMENT — "Thinking level is not supported for this model."` The
generation configs are shared across model families, so the obvious version of
2.95a — adding `thinkingConfig` to `flashConfig` — takes out every 2.5 call site
at once, and `tsc` is perfectly happy about it. Always go through
`withThinking`; never write `thinkingConfig` by hand.

## Measured, not assumed

- **Thinking tokens, `gemini-3.6-flash`, same prompt each time:** unset **861** ·
  HIGH 726 · LOW 424 · MINIMAL 0, against ~150 tokens of visible answer. Thinking
  bills at the output rate. `unset` costing more than `HIGH` is not a typo.
- **Through the shipped code path:** consultant 743 → 449 thinking tokens, answer
  the same length. The guard emits no `thinkingConfig` key at all for 2.5.
- **The round-trip gate passed against the real model:** *"The consultant
  answered with vehicle-specific facts: 41,200, Stage 1, Stage 1 tune"*, 3.5s.
- **R15 at four widths:** 375 one column · 700 two (was **one** — measured
  `grid-template-columns: none` before the change) · 1440 three, shell still
  1280, no overflow · 1600 four at 342px.
- **R6:** `main` padding 24px → 16px below `sm`, 24px at and above.

## Gotchas this session added

1. **`.tap-target-44` is not safe on a wrapped row.** It centres a 44px
   `::after`, so on a ~30px chip it overhangs ~7px each side — into an 8px
   `gap-2`, from both directions. Two rows get overlapping hit areas and the tap
   goes to whichever paints last. Grow the control for real instead. The
   consultant's follow-up chips are the worked example.
2. **Four-up at `2xl` needs the shell widened or it is a regression.**
   `max-w-7xl` stops at 1280px, so a fourth column just makes every card ~290px
   — narrower than at 700px in two-up. RB0 rule 1 says "wider shell" and means it.
3. **Documents are not photos.** `downscaleImage` at its photo defaults (1600px,
   quality floor 0.5) is tuned for a car in a 400px card. An invoice is read, not
   looked at; it gets `DOC_MAX_EDGE` 2048 and a byte budget sized so it stops on
   the first quality rung. Do not collapse the two constants.
4. **Vision is the one 3.x path with no thinking level, on purpose.** Invoice
   extraction is where a regression is invisible — fewer line items still returns
   valid JSON and still passes every gate. The corpus to settle it exists
   (`COWORK_PROMPT_invoice_vision_corpus_2026-07-30.md`). Measure, then set one.
   It is now metered under `invoice_extraction`, so the cost half of that
   question answers itself once the migration is applied.
5. **A test that reads a migration must strip the comments first.** The first
   draft of `ai-usage.test.ts` asserted the file contains no `USING (true)` and
   failed on the migration's own comment *saying* it contains no `USING (true)`.
   It was reading prose and reporting it as schema — the same instrument failure
   this file keeps recording, this time caught in the instrument being written.

6. **Two ceilings, two different failure modes, one shared rule.** Both the
   per-account budget and the demo cap treat a **non-positive limit as "not
   configured", never as "spend nothing"** — read literally, a config typo would
   silence the public demo instantly. Both also **fail open** on a read error:
   what is being protected is a bill, not a security boundary, and the
   per-minute rate limit is still underneath. The honest consequence is that
   both ceilings are best-effort and under-report.
7. **A responsive duplicate must compute its numbers once.** R8 renders the cost
   breakdown as cards below `md` and a table above. Two presentations of the
   same figures drift, and here drift is worse than the bug it fixed — a phone
   showing a different total from the desktop is legible and wrong, and someone
   takes it to a shop.
8. **Bundle output is real evidence when a screen cannot be run.** `expo export`
   plus `strings` on the `.hbc` proved the new Account screen *and* its
   cross-package `@crewchief/core` import are genuinely in the iOS binary. It is
   not a substitute for rendering it, and the roadmap says so.

## Decisions waiting on David — nothing else is blocked on code

1. **5.0 — entity, terms, privacy policy.** *The* binding constraint now.
   2.95 a/b/c and 5.1 are done, so the money track's code is ahead of its
   decisions: 5.2 cannot ship to a real card without this, and it is the only
   item whose duration nobody controls.
2. **The primary button fails AA.** "Sign up" is white on `bg-cyan-600` at
   **3.68:1**; `bg-cyan-700` measures **5.36:1** and closes it. Deliberately not
   changed — `bg-cyan-600` is at 36 sites, so it is the brand colour on every
   primary button, and that is a design decision rather than something to slip
   into an accessibility pass.
3. **The dead components — one down.** `UpcomingMaintenance.tsx` is deleted,
   and `LogServiceModal.tsx` with it: nothing else rendered the modal, and its
   only insert named a column that has never existed under a `source` the CHECK
   forbids. R14 is closed. `MaintenanceHistory.tsx` is the remaining one —
   delete it or wire it up, and R13 only becomes real after that.
4. **D2 (price) after two weeks of meter data**, per Addendum A. The first rows
   already show thinking at 5–8× the visible answer *at `LOW`*, which argues for
   re-testing `MINIMAL` on the non-prose paths once there is a fortnight to read.
5. **Re-upload the M235i photo** in the app, whenever convenient. It is the one
   stored photo predating the browser downscale — 2,328,761 bytes — and
   re-uploading it now shrinks it. Thirty seconds, no code.

## The metering migration — applied

`20260802150000_meter_ai_usage_per_account.sql` was applied to production on
2 Aug and verified against the live schema: table present, 11 columns, 3
indexes, RLS enabled, one policy, the purpose CHECK present, and
`authenticated` holding SELECT only with `anon` holding nothing.

Confirmed working end to end rather than taken on report — rows are landing,
including a `purpose: 'consultant'` row written by prod traffic after the
promote. **The two-week clock on D2 starts from 2 Aug.**

## What I would pick up first, in order

Everything below is unblocked code unless marked. The blocked items are in
"Decisions waiting on David" above.

1. **Run the mobile Account screen.** It is the only thing shipped today that
   has never been rendered — see the Phase 3.3 section below for exactly how far
   it *is* verified, and for the `xcode-select` false alarm not to repeat. **Do
   not press the final delete**: one real account, no throwaway.
2. **5.2 — Stripe checkout (3 ed).** The next code item on the money track, and
   the largest remaining. Blocked from *shipping* by 5.0 but not from being
   built; D2 should be settled first so the price is not hard-coded twice.
3. **2.95d — window the consultant context (1.25 ed).** Size it against the
   meter rather than the guess, per Addendum A. Gate the consultant round trip
   before and after: a worse-grounded answer is still a well-formed answer.
4. **The R10 tail** — data and labels to 13px on mobile. Needs a judgement per
   site, which is why only the 12px floor landed.
5. **Next.js upgrade (3.5–6 ed).** Still a pre-submission gate. Taking money
   does not make 13.5.11 more acceptable and does not move it earlier either.
6. **The R9 lint rule** in `_adherence.oxlintrc.json`. It is in the DS repo, so
   the 44px floor is still a review comment rather than a check — the one guard
   from this session's work that did not get automated.

## Phase 3.3 — account deletion, and how far it is verified

**Built and bundled, not run.** `AccountScreen` is one tap from the garage and
`DELETE /api/v1/account` is wired. What has actually been checked:

- mobile `tsc` clean; web 62 suites / 1090 tests green
- the confirmation rule, the inventory and the summary are shared from
  `packages/core/src/account-deletion.ts` and unit-tested — the web dialog
  imports them rather than keeping its own copy, because **Apple reviews the
  mobile surface** and two implementations let the reviewed one drift weaker
- `npx expo export --platform ios` bundles clean, 636 modules, and the shipped
  `.hbc` contains "Delete my account", "Signed in as", "Every consultant
  conversation" and "Your account has been deleted" — so the screen *and* the
  cross-package core import are genuinely in the binary, not tree-shaken

**Not verified: it has never been rendered.** No simulator run, no tap-through.
Treat 5.1.1(v) as built-not-proven until someone launches it.

> **Do not chase `xcode-select` on this Mac.** The simulator MCP tool reports
> "Xcode is installed but not selected" and asks for
> `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`. **The Mac
> is already configured correctly** — Xcode → Settings → Locations shows
> *Command Line Tools: Xcode 16.3 (16E140)*, `xcode-select -p` returns the
> Xcode path, and `xcrun --find simctl` resolves into `Xcode.app`. The tool's
> precondition check is what is wrong.
>
> Two signals that look like evidence and are not: `xcrun --show-sdk-path` with
> no argument returns the default *macOS* SDK, which Command Line Tools
> legitimately provides, and `/var/db/xcode_select_link` is absent on a machine
> that is nonetheless correctly selected. I read both as faults and sent David
> to fix something that was not broken. Check `xcrun --find simctl` instead.

**When someone does run it, do not press the final delete.** There is one real
account and no throwaway. Verify the screen renders, the button stays disabled
until the phrase is typed, and stop there — item D already proved the cascade
against a disposable account on 1 Aug.

## Environment gaps that are not code

- `MOBILE_TEST_TOKEN` in `.env` **expired 02:58 UTC 2 Aug**. Three bearer checks
  in `verify-mobile-contract` fail against any target until it is refreshed off
  the simulator.
- `CONSULTANT_HEALTH_SECRET` is not set on prod, so `/api/health/consultant`
  returns 503 there and the canary cannot check prod. The candidate has it.

# Handoff — 2 Aug 2026, ~08:00 (morning session, superseded)

Written at the end of the morning session. **Superseded by the entry above** —
its "what I would pick up first" list is spent. Kept because its gotchas and its
production verification still hold.

## Where things stand

- **Production is live and verified.** `crewchief-demo.davidmasterson.co` serves
  `16c5d752`, the `demo-live` merge commit. It promotes `main` at `17b932e9`.
  `main` and `demo-live` are both pushed; working tree clean.
- **Branch `design/live-site-audit`** is merged into `main` and pushed. It can be
  deleted whenever; nothing depends on it.
- 57 suites, 978 tests, green. `npm run typecheck` clean.

## Confirmed on production, not assumed

Each of these was checked against the live domain after the promote finished,
because a green local build has been wrong before:

- `og:image` is `https://crewchief-demo.davidmasterson.co/opengraph-image`,
  returns `200 image/png`. **The share card works for the first time.**
- Zero occurrences of `localhost` in the deployed HTML.
- `/dark-roomb.jpeg` and `/garage-interior-1920.jpg` both 404 — the
  unprovenanced photography is gone from the site, not just from the repo.
- `/vehicles/wrx/hero-3x2.avif` serves 200 at 285 KB, against 861 KB of JPEG.
- `verify-demo.mjs` passes against prod (2 pre-existing warnings, unrelated).

## What changed in the tooling

- **New devDependency: `sharp`.** Only needed to regenerate derivatives —
  outputs are committed and Netlify never runs it. `npm run build:images`
  (add `--force` to rebuild everything).
- **Generated file:** `packages/core/src/vehicle-blur.ts`. Do not hand-edit; it
  is rewritten by the script above.
- **New tests:** `image-weight-budget.test.ts`, `reduced-motion.test.ts`. Both
  are static analysis, so both are registered in
  `tests-test-real-code.test.ts`'s `STATIC_ANALYSIS_SUITES` — a new suite that
  imports nothing will fail until it is registered *with a justification*.
- **New promote-gate step:** the share card check, between the version check and
  the demo contract.

## Gotchas worth knowing before you edit

1. **The promote gate's share-card check tests the candidate's origin, not the
   URL in the tag.** `metadataBase` is the production literal, so a candidate
   correctly advertises the prod domain; fetching that would test the build you
   are replacing. The first run of this gate failed for exactly that reason —
   a red check describing prod while the candidate was fine. If you change
   `metadataBase`, re-read that block.
2. **`.service-bay` and `.cockpit-belt` are single-element background stacks on
   purpose.** They go on containers that already have children, so every layer
   has to composite *underneath* content. A pseudo-element or child overlay will
   paint on top of the card. `.photo-plate` gets away with it only because its
   children are positioned.
3. **`repeat` vs `repeat-x` on a banded background layer.** `repeat` tiles
   vertically too, so the beltline's brushed grain climbed out of its 11% band
   and textured the whole page. Caught visually, not by a test.
4. **React 18.2 has no `fetchPriority` prop.** It is spelled lowercase and cast
   in `VehicleIdentity`. React 19 adds the camelCase one — switching early
   silently stops it being emitted.
5. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is optional and should stay unset in production.**
   The fallback is the real domain, so unset degrades to *correct for prod*. Set
   it on deploy previews so a preview's card stops claiming to be the live site.

## What I would pick up first, in order

1. **Item 10 (`DEMO_IMAGES`)** — the only open item that is a live hazard rather
   than new work, and the only one blocked purely on information. Query the live
   database for what the three demo `image_url` values actually are. If they are
   the local hero paths, the migration has been applied and the map can be
   retired once the card has a card-sized source.
2. **Item 17's contrast finding** — `white/30` and `white/40` body text fails
   WCAG AA (2.71:1 and 3.78:1). App-wide tokens, so it is a Design call, but it
   is a real accessibility defect on a portfolio piece and it is cheap to fix.
3. **Commit `photography/build_assets.py`** if it exists on the machine. Until
   then the demo derivatives are not reproducible and the crop anchors live only
   inside the JPEGs.
4. **Item 13's second half** — the DS/`tokens.json` promotion, so the React
   Native build inherits the cockpit language instead of re-deriving it.
5. **Item 15's LCP/CLS**, if someone will own the flake budget.

## Rollback, if the demo looks wrong

Revert the merge commit on `demo-live` and push. The demo returns to its
previous build without touching `main`:

```
git checkout demo-live && git revert -m 1 16c5d752 && git push origin demo-live
```

If the site looks stale rather than wrong, check for cached CSS/JS before
suspecting the code — that has been the answer more than once here.
