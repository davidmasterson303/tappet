/**
 * Record that an anonymous visitor reached a step on the front door.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase 2.97d, and a **ship gate** rather than a component (advisory P1, 7.6).
 * Phase 2.97 is justified entirely on producing demand evidence before money is
 * spent forming an entity; without this the phase produces a nicer landing page
 * and no knowledge. It is also the smallest line in the phase, which is exactly
 * why it is a gate — under time pressure it is the first thing that would go.
 *
 * ── It cannot fail a request, same hard rule as the AI meter ────────────────
 *
 * A stranger is mid-way through finding out whether their repair quote is fair.
 * Whether we recorded that they got there is not their problem, and an
 * instrumentation bug that turns a working answer into an error is strictly
 * worse than an unrecorded step. So every path returns rather than throws, the
 * caller does not await it, and a failed write is logged at warn and dropped.
 *
 * The honest cost of that, stated for the same reason `lib/ai-usage.ts` states
 * it: **this under-reports.** A dropped write is a visitor who got somewhere and
 * was not counted. `funnelCounts` is cumulative specifically so that a lost
 * middle step cannot produce a funnel where more people were answered than
 * uploaded — but the absolute numbers are a floor, and this table is not an
 * accounting record.
 *
 * ── Idempotent by construction ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `UNIQUE (visitor_id, step)` plus `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` means a reload, a
 * prefetch, a back-button or a retry all collapse to one row. `landed` is the
 * event this matters for — it fires on a render — and solving it here rather
 * than at four call sites is why the constraint is in the schema.

/**
 * Rebuild the funnel over a window. Phase 2.97d, the last piece.
 *
 * Reads rows and groups them in memory rather than aggregating in SQL. That is
 * the right trade at this size and is worth stating so it gets revisited rather
 * than inherited: the table holds at most one row per visitor per step, so a
 * month of a surface doing a few hundred visits a day is tens of thousands of
 * rows of two short columns. When that stops being true the fix is a SQL
 * `GROUP BY` behind this same signature, and `groupByVisitor` plus `funnelRates`
 * keep their tests either way.
 *
 * **Not fire-and-forget, and not silent.** Unlike every write in this module,
 * this is a read nobody's request depends on — it feeds a report. So it throws
 * on failure rather than returning an empty funnel. An empty funnel and a
 * broken query look identical, and the whole purpose of this instrument is to
 * be believed: `0%` conversion reported by a failed read is worse than an
 * error, because someone would act on it.
