      ── ⚠ SEC-05 · the atomic path ────────────────────────────────────────────

      `consume_rate_limit` is one statement — `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE
      SET request_count = request_count + 1 RETURNING` — so there is no interval
      in which two callers can both believe they are first.

      What it replaces was read-then-insert against a table with **no unique
      constraint**, and the consequence was not a lost count. Two concurrent
      requests both inserted; every later `.maybeSingle()` in that window hit two
      rows, PostgREST answered `PGRST116`, and that landed in the `fetchError`
      branch below — which **returns `allowed: true` with a full allowance**.
      The limiter switched off for that identifier for the rest of the window,
      and an attacker triggered it deliberately with two parallel requests at
      each boundary. It defeated the `ai` (10/min) and `upload` (5/min) tiers,
      the two standing in front of Gemini spend.

      ⚠ The fallback below is **not** dead code and must not be deleted as
      such. `CLAUDE.md` §2: the database and the migrations folder disagree in
      both directions, and this function arrives in `20260824110000`. A deploy
      carrying this file can reach production before somebody runs it, and a
      limiter that throws because an RPC is missing is a limiter that takes the
      product down. It is loud and it is temporary — delete it once the
      migration is confirmed applied.

/**
 * A bucket key for a request.
 *
 * ── The platform address is preferred, and it is the only unspoofable one ───
 *
 * `cc-tech-0003` at high confidence, and erratum T1: `X-Forwarded-For` is a
 * request header, so a caller can write a fresh value per request and land in a
 * fresh bucket every time. A limiter keyed on it counts to one forever while
 * reporting that it works. `platformClientIp` reads only headers the edge
 * *sets* from the connection rather than forwards — see that module for the
 * trust assumption, which is about the host and not about the transport.
 *
 * ── Why the spoofable fallback is still here ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because removing it could be worse than the weakness. If the platform header
 * is ever absent in production — and that could not be verified from a
 * development machine without deploying something that echoes request headers —
 * then a platform-only version collapses **all** traffic onto `'unknown'`, one
 * shared 60/minute bucket, and the first bot takes the demo down for every real
 * visitor. That is a live outage traded for a hardening.
 *
 * So the order is: platform address, then the old behaviour unchanged. This is
 * **strictly no worse than before anywhere, and strictly better wherever the
 * platform supplies an address** — which on Netlify is every externally
 * originated request, since the edge sets it from the peer address. The
 * fallback is then reached only in local development.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately does not fix ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is still an IP bucket, and IP buckets are a secondary control. The six
 * callers are all authenticated routes where this is not the security
 * boundary — RLS and `lib/api-auth.ts` are — and all six call it *before*
 * authenticating, so the account id that would be the correct key is not
 * available yet. Reordering those handlers is a real change with real
 * behavioural risk and is not smuggled in here.
 *
 * **The anonymous front door must not use this function.** Its primary control
 * is the spend ceiling in `lib/ai-budget.ts`, and its secondary bucket keys on
 * `platformClientIp` directly, with `null` meaning the bucket does not apply
 * rather than meaning `'unknown'`.

    ── ⚠ SEC-15 · a caller-supplied header may not buy a private allowance ────

    `x-forwarded-for` and `x-real-ip` are **set by the caller**. A limiter keyed
    on them is a limiter whose bucket the caller chooses: send a fresh one per
    request and every request is a new identity with a full allowance.
    `packages/core/src/client-ip.ts` says exactly this and forbids the fallback:

      *"an attacker can **cause** the platform header to be missing by not being
      behind the edge."*

    ⚠ **The fallback is kept anyway, and that is not an oversight.** The
    decision is recorded in `front-door-controls.test.ts:222-235` with its
    reasoning: a platform-only version collapses every request onto one shared
    bucket if `x-nf-client-connection-ip` is ever absent in production, which
    trades a hardening for a live outage on the recruiter-facing demo — and
    could not be verified from a development machine. That argument still holds
    and I could not settle it from here either.

    So the fallback narrows instead of disappearing. **The tier decides whether
    a caller-supplied identity is trusted**, because the two questions have
    different answers:

      `default`          browsing traffic, 60/min, nothing spent. A per-caller
                         bucket here is worth more than the abuse it permits,
                         and this is the tier the outage argument is about.

      `ai` / `upload`    the two standing in front of Gemini spend. An
                         unverifiable caller gets a **shared** bucket, so
                         claiming a new identity buys nothing. Worst case a
                         genuinely un-attributable user waits — which costs them
                         a minute, not us a bill.

    ⚠ The check that would let the fallback go entirely: confirm
    `x-nf-client-connection-ip` is present on **every** request to a deployed
    function, on both Netlify sites. If it is, delete everything below the
    platform lookup and this comment with it.
