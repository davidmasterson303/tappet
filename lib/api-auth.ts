/**
 * Well Kept - API route authorization
 *
 * Every API route that touches vehicle-scoped data must run through
 * `authorizeVehicleAccess` before it reaches for a privileged client.
 *
 * The rules it encodes:
 *
 *   - Demo vehicles are world-readable and never writable. They are shared
 *     across every anonymous visitor, so a write would corrupt the public
 *     demo for everyone.
 *   - Everything else requires a session AND ownership of the vehicle.
 *   - The service-role client bypasses RLS entirely, so it is only handed
 *     back once ownership has been proven.
 *
 * Callers that receive `{ ok: false }` must return `result.response`
 * unchanged — it carries the correct status and a message that does not
 * leak whether the resource exists.
