/**
 * Read what an account has spent this month and decide whether it may spend
 * more. Phase 5.1.
 *
 * ── The demo is capped too, and degrades rather than breaking ───────────────
 *
 * Anonymous traffic (`user_id IS NULL`) is the only unauthenticated path to a
 * model in this application, and it was the largest uncontrolled cost in it.
 * An earlier version of this file left it uncapped, reasoning that a fuse
 * blowing on the recruiter-facing demo was worse than the bill. That protects
 * the wrong thing — an unbounded bill is not safer than a quiet consultant.
 *
 * `checkDemoBudget` bounds it with two windows against one shared pool, and
 * the design point is that **exhausting it does not break the page**. The
 * garage, dossiers, service history, health scores and cost tables are all
 * stored data that never touches a model; only live chat pauses, and it says
 * why and when it returns. The daily window is what makes that survivable —
 * a monthly cap alone would mean one bad afternoon silences the demo for three
 * weeks.
 *
 * ── It fails open, and that is also a decision ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * If the query fails — the table missing, the service key unset on a preview,
 * Postgres unreachable — the call is allowed. A budget check that fails closed
 * turns a metering outage into a total product outage, and the thing being
 * protected is a bill, not a security boundary. The failure is logged at warn.
 *
 * The honest consequence: **this ceiling is best-effort.** It cannot be relied
 * on as the only control, which is why the per-minute rate limit stays exactly
 * where it is.

 *
 * ── Why a read failure returns `free` rather than bailing out ───────────────
 *
 * Every other failure path in this file returns `UNMEASURED` — allowed, nothing
 * counted — because what it protects is a bill and an unreadable usage table is
 * no reason to take the product offline.
 *
 * This one is different and deliberately quieter. A failed entitlement read
 * means we do not know whether somebody paid, and the two ways to be wrong are
 * not symmetrical: guessing `paid` gives the product away to anyone whose read
 * fails, while guessing `free` puts a paying customer on a ceiling documented
 * as one "an ordinary month of real use does not touch". The first is silent
 * and unbounded; the second is visible, survivable, and complained about.
 *
 * It is logged at warn precisely so that complaint has something to match.
