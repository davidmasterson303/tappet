 * Turn a vehicle's stored image columns into one renderable URL.

 * storage path in a private bucket, not a URL. The web client exchanges it for
 * a signed URL per read (`hooks/useSignedUrl.ts`). An API client handed the raw
 * column would have nothing it could render and no obvious way to find out why,
 * so the exchange happens server-side and the wire format carries a URL or
 * null — never a scheme the caller has to know about.
 *
 * Precedence matches `useVehicleImage` deliberately: the owner's photo wins
 * outright once one exists, rather than falling back to the stock image while
 * it resolves. Web and mobile disagreeing about which photo a car has would be
 * the same class of bug this codebase keeps finding — a second implementation
 * of a rule that already had one.
 *
 * Never throws and never returns a `placeholder://` value. Every failure path
 * degrades to the stock photo or to null, because the caller renders a photo
 * or it doesn't; a broken URL is worse than no URL.
