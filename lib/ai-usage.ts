/**
 * Record what a Gemini call cost, per account.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase 2.95c. Three things wait on it and none of them is observability: tier
 * limits (5.1) have no per-account number to enforce against, decision D2 (the
 * price point) is currently built on estimated tokens, and 2.95d is sized
 * against a guess about how per-user cost grows with tenure.
 *
 * ── It cannot fail a request, and that is a hard rule ───────────────────────
 *
 * A user asked their advisor a question. Whether the meter wrote a row is not
 * their problem, and a metering bug that turns a working answer into an error
 * is strictly worse than an unmetered call. So:
 *
 *   - every path returns rather than throws;
 *   - the caller is not asked to await it (see `recordAiUsage` vs the fire-and-
 *     forget wrapper below);
 *   - a failed write is logged at warn and dropped.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is honest and worth stating: **this meter
 * under-reports rather than over-reports.** A row lost to a database hiccup is
 * a call that happened and was not billed to anyone. For setting a price that
 * is the safe direction to be wrong in — you will price against a floor — but
 * it means the table is not an accounting record and should never be presented
 * as one.
