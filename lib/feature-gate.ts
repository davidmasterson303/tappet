/**
 * The server-side half of the feature gate — the pricing decision of 24 Aug.
 *
 * ── Why this is a sibling of `ai-budget.ts` and not part of it ──────────────
 *
 * They answer different questions and fail in **opposite directions**, which is
 * exactly the pairing `entitlement.ts` already documents:
 *
 *   - `checkMonthlyBudget` protects **a bill**. An unreadable usage row lets the
 *     call through, because taking every AI feature offline over a database
 *     hiccup costs more than the tokens would.
 *   - this protects **revenue**. An unreadable entitlement resolves to `free`,
 *     because reading a broken row as paid gives the product away to precisely
 *     the case somebody would try to manufacture.
 *
 * Folding them into one function would force one failure direction on both, and
 * whichever was chosen would be wrong for the other half.
 *
 * Both still run. The gate decides *whether* a feature may be used at all; the
 * budget decides whether this particular call is affordable. A subscriber past
 * the fuse is still refused, and that is deliberate — `paid-features.ts` calls
 * the ceiling abuse protection behind the gate rather than a thing being sold.

/**
 * ── ⚠ Off until there is something to buy ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `PAID_FEATURES_ENFORCED` is not a rollout flag and must not become one. It
 * encodes one rule, stated at length in `paid-features.ts`: **a feature may
 * only be gated behind a purchase the app can actually make.**
 *
 * As of writing, E8 is unfinished — `PaywallScreen` is mounted by no navigator
 * and no StoreKit library is installed. Enforcing now would take the advisor,
 * invoice scanning and the dossier from every existing account and offer them
 * no way back.
 *
 * ⚠ Anything other than the exact string `'true'` is off, including `'1'`,
 * `'yes'` and `'TRUE'`. A gate that switches on for a typo is a gate that
 * switches on by accident, and the accident here is a support inbox.
 *
 * ⚠ It is read per call rather than captured at module load. A captured value
 * bakes the environment into the bundle and makes the switch a redeploy of the
 * whole app rather than a config change plus a restart.
