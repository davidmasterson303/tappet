/**
 * Deciding that a notification is warranted, and sending it.
 *
 * The piece that joins everything else: `recalls.ts` says what a notice means,
 * `notifications.ts` says what it reads like, `push-send.ts` delivers it, and
 * `recall_notifications` remembers what has already been said. None of them
 * talked to each other until this.
 *
 * ── Why "what did we already say" is a table read and not a timestamp ───────
 *
 * See the migration's header at length. Short version: comparing against
 * `nhtsa_data.last_checked` needs no new schema and silently drops a notice
 * whenever a send fails between the two writes. A row written *after* a
 * successful send cannot.
 *
 * ── Why a severity upgrade re-notifies ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NHTSA revises. A recall issued as ordinary can be upgraded to `parkIt` — do
 * not drive — weeks later, under the same campaign number. Deduplicating on the
 * campaign alone would mean the most urgent notice this product can send is
 * exactly the one it stays silent about, because it already mentioned that
 * campaign in a calmer tone. So the stored severity is compared too, and an
 * escalation is a new notification.
 *
 * De-escalation is not. NHTSA softening a notice is not worth a push.
