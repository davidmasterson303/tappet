/**
 * Run the anonymous quote check. Phase 2.97b, decision D9.
 *
 * Glue only — the prompt, the response contract and every bound on the model's
 * output are in `packages/core/src/quote-check.ts` and tested there.
 *
 * ── The thinking level is the point of this being its own call site ─────────
 *
 * `parseInvoiceLineItems` is deliberately the one remaining 3.x site at the
 * model default, on the argument that nothing measures whether cutting its
 * thinking costs accuracy. **That argument does not transfer here.** An
 * unauthenticated endpoint accepting full-resolution phone photographs, running
 * a model that defaults to medium thinking, is the money faucet 2.95a was built
 * to close. `LOW` matches every other set site in the application.
 *
 * ── `surface` is derived, not passed ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `deriveSurface` reaches `anonymous` on its own from `userId: null` and no
 * vehicle. That is exactly what `6e1d727` built it for — "the front door gets
 * correct attribution on the day it ships without touching the other ten call
 * sites" — so passing it explicitly here would be the one call site opting out
 * of the mechanism designed for it.
 *
 * ── Metering requires `20260803210000` ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `quote_check` is a new purpose and the CHECK constraint must accept it before
 * this runs in production, or every front-door row is silently dropped by a
 * fire-and-forget writer. Unapplied as of writing.

 * shape by sweeping on write, and the property that makes it sound here is
 * pleasant: **cleanup frequency scales with the growth it is cleaning up.** A

 * ── Why 30 days when the cookie lives 24 hours ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * An unclaimed scan is unclaimable the moment its visitor cookie expires, so
 * strictly 24 hours would do. 30 days is deliberate slack: this is a delete
 * against real rows, the retention rule is new, and the failure mode of being
 * too eager is destroying a scan someone was about to claim. Being late costs
 * a few kilobytes.
 *
 * ── Claimed rows are never touched ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `claimed_by IS NULL` is the whole safety of this function. A claimed scan
 * belongs to an account and is deleted with it by the FK cascade, never on a
 * timer — someone's saved estimate must not evaporate at 30 days. Tested.
