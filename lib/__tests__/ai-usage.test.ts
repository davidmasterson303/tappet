 * The database write needs a service-role client and is not tested here. What
 * is tested is everything around it, because those are the parts that fail
 * without failing: a row of zeroes that drags every average down, a total that
 * silently omits thinking tokens, a purpose the application knows and the CHECK
 * constraint refuses.
 *
 * That last one is the reason this file reads the migration. The write path is
 * fire-and-forget by design — it cannot throw, so a rejected INSERT is a warn
 * line and a missing row, and the first symptom is a cost report that is quietly
 * incomplete for one feature. There is no runtime signal. A build-time one is
 * the only kind available.
