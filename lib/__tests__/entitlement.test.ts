/**
 * Whether an account is entitled to what it is asking for.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Phase 6, E7. Every ambiguous input here resolves to `free`, and that is the
 * opposite default from `decideBudget` in the same subsystem — which reads a
 * misconfigured limit as "no ceiling" and lets the call through.
 *
 * The two disagree on purpose. `decideBudget` protects a **bill**, so failing
 * open costs money and failing closed costs an outage. This protects
 * **revenue**, so failing open gives the product away — silently, to exactly
 * the malformed rows an attacker would aim for — while failing closed puts a
 * paying customer on a generous ceiling they can complain about.
 *
 * Most of the tests below are that asymmetry, one input at a time.
