/**
 * The two hostnames ask a visitor for different things.
 *
 * ── Why this is a decision worth a test ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until 22 Aug both sites led with "Enter demo". On the recruiter host that is
 * right — somebody sent to look at David's work should land in the working
 * product in one tap. On `crewchief.davidmasterson.co`, which is the App Store
 * listing's URL and the origin the phone talks to, it said "this is a demo"
 * more loudly than any tagline could. **The primary call to action is the
 * positioning**, more than the copy above it is.
 *
 * ⚠ The failure this pins is silent and directional. If the site flag stops
 * reaching the client — a provider removed, a prop dropped, a refactor to a
 * hostname check that returns nothing during hydration — the page still
 * renders, still looks finished, and quietly shows one site's framing on the
 * other. The default is `false`/product for that reason, and the assertions
 * below check both directions rather than just the new one.
