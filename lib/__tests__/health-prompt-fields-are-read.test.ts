/**
 * Every field the health prompt asks for is a field the parser reads.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── ⚠ The defect, and why nothing caught it ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **Every health score Well Kept ever generated was 70.** The prompt asked the
 * model for `healthScore`; the parser read `healthData.health_score`; the value
 * was therefore always `undefined`, and the next line substituted a documented
 * neutral. `redFlags` met the same fate and was forced to `[]`.
 * `maintenanceStatus`, `recallStatus` and `issuesOverview` were not merely
 * wrong — a wholesale `healthData = JSON.parse(…)` dropped the defaults, so the
 * three keys were **absent from the stored row entirely**, which is exactly the
 * shape the live API returned when it was checked on 23 Aug.
 *
 * Three green suites are named for this behaviour and not one of them could see
 * it. `health-claims.test.ts` and `absence-is-not-an-all-clear.test.ts` test
 * pure functions that `generateVehicleHealthSummary` never calls on this path.
 * `health-sees-filed-invoices.test.ts` *does* target that function and is
 * entirely source-text regex — it never parses a response.
 *
 * That is this repo's signature failure: **an instrument that measures the
 * right number for the wrong question.** The pure functions are well tested;
 * whether anything calls them correctly is tested by almost nothing.
 *
 * ── What this checks, and why it is a source scan ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The invariant is a *correspondence between two strings in one file* — the
 * word inside a prompt template and the word after `parsed.`. Executing the
 * function would need a live Gemini call, a live Supabase and a real vehicle;
 * the correspondence is on disk and cannot drift without one of the two sides
 * being edited.
 *
 * ⚠ It deliberately does **not** check that the parser reads the snake_case
 * spelling too. That is the column's name, it is the caller's business, and
 * pinning it here would make renaming a column a two-file change for no gain.
 * What must never happen again is a prompt asking for a word nothing reads.
