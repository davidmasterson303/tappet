/**
 * The garage-door intro plays once, and stops playing for good reasons.
 *
 * Every condition here corresponds to a way the previous implementation
 * actually failed, so these are regression tests rather than a specification
 * written after the fact:
 *
 *   - `alreadyPlayed` — `LandingHero` had no gate at all and ran its curtain
 *     on every single visit to /demo.
 *   - `reducedMotion` — it never checked, despite the comment above the
 *     reduced-motion block in globals.css stating that JS-driven effects must
 *     check `matchMedia` themselves, because the CSS override cannot reach
 *     them. Its curtain was driven by framer-motion, which is JS.
 *   - `documentHidden` — a full-screen fixed curtain whose animation is
 *     throttled mid-flight stays parked over the page. Observed on the
 *     predecessor: loading /demo in a hidden browser pane left it frozen 5%
 *     into a 1.5s lift, indefinitely.
 *
 * The timing constants are asserted too. They look like trivia until you note
 * that `GarageDoorAnimation` fired its completion callback on a hand-copied
 * 1200ms timer against a 1500ms CSS animation — 300ms early, every time,
 * because the two numbers lived in different files with nothing tying them
 * together.
