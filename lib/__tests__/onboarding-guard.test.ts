/**
 * Onboarding runs once — but "Add Vehicle" still has to work.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Task 1.6's third done-condition. Two things are being guarded here and only
 * one of them is in the plan's wording.
 *
 * The stated one: a returning user should not be dropped back into the VIN
 * form. The unstated one: `app/garage/page.tsx` links to `/onboard` from its
 * Add-vehicle buttons, so *every* user who clicks one already has a vehicle.
 * A guard keyed on vehicle count alone would redirect them straight back to
 * the garage and make a second car unaddable — a polish task turning into a
 * functional regression on the app's main flow. Hence `?from=garage`.
 *
 * The predicate itself is argued in `packages/core/src/onboarding.ts`: vehicle count, not
 * the profiles row, because the profile is trigger-created on signup and is
 * therefore true of a brand-new user.
