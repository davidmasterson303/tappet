/**
 * An odometer goes up, except when the owner mistyped.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Phase 5.6's service notification opens on a mileage confirmation, which makes
 * this the first value a push asks someone to type. Two rules here are not
 * obvious and both were chosen against the simpler alternative:
 *
 *   1. **A decrease is refused by default and allowed as a correction.** Pure
 *      monotonicity is the obvious rule and it is a trap: enter 160000 for
 *      16000 once and every later reading is below the stored value, so the car
 *      is locked at a wrong number permanently — with no support channel to
 *      undo it, and that number then feeds every service-due calculation.
 *   2. **A huge jump is gated the same way**, because unlike a decrease it is
 *      silently plausible. Nothing about 16000 → 160000 looks wrong to a
 *      server that only checks the direction of travel.
