/**
 * Drilling into a vehicle must not lose facts the list already showed.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * `/api/v1/vehicles` selects `nhtsa_data(recalls)` and
 * `vehicle_health_summary(...)`. `/api/v1/load-vehicle` selected neither — so
 * `VehicleDetailScreen` declared both, derived a band and a recall count from
 * them, and rendered a Health card and a recall card **that could never
 * appear**. Tapping a garage card reading "70 · FAIR · 2 recalls" opened a
 * screen showing no score and no recalls.
 *
 * Every check in this repo passed while that was true. Both fields are
 * optional, so it typechecked; the screen degrades silently by design, so
 * nothing threw; and no test rendered the screen. It became visible the first
 * time a human opened it, on 5 Aug, which was itself only possible because
 * deep links had just been added.
 *
 * ── The rule, stated once ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A detail endpoint is a superset of the list endpoint for the same entity.
 * Not a style preference: the list is what the user was looking at a moment
 * ago, so anything it knew and the detail does not reads as data that
 * *disappeared*. The direction only ever fails one way, which is why this
 * compares sets rather than pinning an exact list — `load-vehicle` may return
 * more (`vin`, `updated_at`) and that is fine.
 *
 * ── Why source and not a request ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both routes would need a live Supabase, and the property is which columns
 * are *asked for* — a string constant in each file. The 5 Aug fix was verified
 * separately against the real database (the demo Accord returns
 * `health_score: 74`), but that is a one-off measurement and this is the part
 * that has to keep being true.
