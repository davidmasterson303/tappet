/**
 * The demo answers without spending anything, and says that it is a demo.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Two properties, and the second is the one this project keeps having to
 * relearn. The demo must cost nothing — that is what makes "worst case per
 * prospect is zero" true in `ai/pricing.ts`. And it must not present a
 * pre-written answer as one a model just produced, which is the same defect as
 * the scan sweep that depicted an examination nobody ran, the hero timer that
 * counted nothing, and the quote bar that filled while the request was still in
 * flight.
