/**
 * No table may gain a new blanket RLS policy.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Roadmap item E, and the thing that makes 20260731030000 and its successor
 * stick. Those migrations close blanket policies on four tables; **neither is
 * enforced by anything**, so a future migration could reopen the hole and every
 * check in this repo would stay green.
 *
 * `vehicles-rls-posture.test.ts` has asserted this exact property since 29 Jul
 * and is pointed at one table. This is the same idea across all of them.
 *
 * ── What a blanket policy is, and why it is not a style problem ─────────────
 *
 * A PERMISSIVE policy whose USING or WITH CHECK expression is literally `true`
 * grants unrestricted access for its command. Postgres ORs permissive policies
 * together, so **one blanket policy nullifies every scoped policy beside it**.
 * A file that adds a careful `user_id = auth.uid()` policy to a table that
 * already has `USING (true)` reads as though it closed a hole and closes
 * nothing.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. It nearly caused a leak on 30 Jul: a one-line
 * `GRANT SELECT … TO anon` on `maintenance_line_items` rested on "RLS still
 * decides which rows", which was true only if the scoped policy were the only
 * policy. It was not. David caught it in review — this is what would have
 * caught it without him.
 *
 * ── What this does and does not prove ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A static replay of the migration corpus: it proves what a **rebuild** would
 * produce, not what the live database is running. That distinction is the
 * finding `vehicles-rls-posture.test.ts` records — live was fixed by hand
 * through a dashboard under policy names that appear nowhere in this repo, so
 * history and database have already been proved to disagree.
 *
 * Which makes this more useful, not less. A fresh environment is built from
 * these files. If they declare an open database, that is what a rebuild gets.
 *
 * ── Measured against live, 31 Jul. The two disagree, and by how much ────────
 *
 * Read-only probe of the live project, so this is not an argument from first
 * principles. **The baseline overstates live exposure, in the safe direction.**
 *
 *   - **Ten of the thirteen tables are not granted to `anon` at all.** They
 *     return `42501`, which is a GRANT failure — it happens *before* any policy
 *     is consulted. Their blanket policies are unreachable by an anonymous
 *     caller whatever the policy says. That grant-versus-RLS distinction is the
 *     thing both July migrations are built around, and it is the thing a
 *     confident wrong answer was given about on 30 Jul.
 *
 *   - **The three that are granted are already scoped in the database.**
 *     `nhtsa_data`, `vehicle_health_summary` and `vehicle_knowledge_base` each
 *     hold four rows; an anonymous reader sees three. A live `USING (true)`
 *     would return four. So those three are scoped live and this corpus does
 *     not know it — drift in the safe direction, and the same drift
 *     `vehicles-rls-posture.test.ts` found on `vehicles`.
 *
 * So the honest label for this list is **"blanket policies a rebuild would
 * declare"**, not "blanket policies this database has". Keeping the sixteen
 * frozen is still right — a rebuild really would produce them — but nobody
 * should read the number as live exposure. It is not.
 *
 * What is *not* measured: these policies are `TO public`, which includes
 * `authenticated`. Measuring what a signed-in account can reach needs a user
 * JWT, and none was available when this was written. That is the larger
 * surface, since an authenticated caller plausibly holds grants `anon` does
 * not — and it is the open question this file cannot answer.

/**
 * The blanket policies a rebuild would currently produce, reachable by

 *
 * Frozen as a baseline rather than fixed in one go, deliberately. Sixteen
 * policies across **thirteen** tables — twelve with one each, plus
 * `service_items` with four — cannot be closed in a single reviewed change,
 * and demanding that as the price of having a ratchet is how a project ends up
 * with no ratchet. Freezing them makes the *next* one fail the build, which is
 * the property actually worth having.
 *
 * Removing an entry requires a migration that drops it. Adding one is not a
 * way to make a failing build pass.
 *
 * **Was sixteen, then ten; is eight.** `20260731030000` closed
 * `maintenance_line_items` and `20260731040000` closed `service_items` ×4,
 * `known_issue_tracking` and `modification_tracking`. `20260801140000` closed
 * the last two that hold user content: `vehicle_documents` and
 * `consultant_conversations`. All are absent below because the replay sees
 * their drops — and the honesty assertion is what forced this list to be
 * updated rather than left stale, which is the ratchet working as designed. It
 * fired on exactly those two entries when that migration landed.
 *
 * Eight remain. What a rebuild from these files would expose, by kind — and
 * note the framing, which is "a rebuild would", not "the database does":
 *
 *   - `consultant_documents`, `quote_requests`, `labor_bundles` — empty.
 *   - `location_zones`, `modification_details` — shared reference data, the
 *     same rows for everybody.
 *   - `vehicle_knowledge_base`, `vehicle_health_summary`, `nhtsa_data` — per
 *     vehicle, and therefore per user. Derived rather than authored — a
 *     research profile, a computed health band, NHTSA recall lookups — so none
 *     of it is a document or transcript someone wrote.
 *
 * ── Measured live, 1 Aug, by scripts/audit-remaining-blanket-tables.sql ──────
 *
 * **Seven of these eight are already scoped in the database.** A schema-wide
 * sweep for unconditional permissive policies returned exactly one row in all
 * of `public`:
 *
 *     location_zones | "Anyone can read location zones" | SELECT | {public}
 *
 * and that one is defensible — `anon` holds no SELECT grant on it (42501 from
 * outside), and it covers 16 rows of shared reference data with no vehicle_id.
 * The name reads as intent.
 *
 * **A correction to the paragraph above, which was mine.** It said the three
 * per-vehicle tables still meant "a signed-in user can see rows about another
 * user's car". Measured, all three carry both arms —
 * `EXISTS (… WHERE user_id = auth.uid() OR is_demo)` — so a signed-in caller
 * reaches their own rows and the demo rows and nobody else's. That paragraph
 * was written *as* a correction to an earlier overclaim, and was itself more
 * pessimistic than the database. Fifth corpus-versus-live gap; second in the
 * safe direction.
 *
 * The proof is also the first non-vacuous RLS test this project has run.
 * `nhtsa_data`, `vehicle_health_summary` and `vehicle_knowledge_base` each hold
 * four rows — three demo, one real — so an anonymous read *could* have returned
 * the real one and did not, on all three. Every earlier anon check ran against
 * tables where every row was a demo row and could not have failed.
 *
 * ── So why is this list still eight ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because it measures the corpus, and the corpus is unchanged. Lowering it to
 * one was tried: the replay still finds the other seven, so
 * "introduces no NEW blanket policy" fails and names them. The baseline cannot
 * drop ahead of migrations that actually drop the policies — which is the
 * ratchet refusing to let a live measurement be recorded as repo progress, and
 * is correct.
 *
 * What live's state does change is the *urgency*, not the status. No security
 * migration is needed. A rebuild from these files still gets an open database,
 * and the remaining work is to codify what live already does — now writable
 * from measurement rather than from guesswork, which is the whole reason the
 * audit script exists.
 *
 * **What this list is, restated because it was just misread — by the person
 * editing it.** These entries describe what a rebuild from these files would
 * declare. They are not a report of live exposure, and the two have now been
 * measured apart four times.
 *
 * `20260801140000` was written and committed on the premise that the
 * `vehicle_documents` and `consultant_conversations` entries below meant a
 * signed-in user could read another user's invoices and transcripts. A live
 * catalog read on 1 Aug found both already scoped with owner and demo arms,
 * RLS enabled, and no unconditional policy on either. Live was *tighter* than
 * this list implies — the first drift in that direction.
 *
 * So: an entry here is a rebuild hazard and a reason to write a migration. It
 * is never, on its own, evidence that the database is open. That takes a
 * catalog read, and the header above has said so since the file was written.

    ── Public by design is not a hole, and it is not the baseline either ────

    The argument at the top of this file is about tables with per-user rows:
    a blanket policy ORs over every scoped one and the scoping is gone. A
    table with **no** per-user rows has nothing to nullify — `vehicle_plates`
    (11 Sep) is a library of generated night plates keyed by model generation,
    read anonymously by the garage so a card can show its plate the moment it
    is ready. Its `USING (true)` SELECT is the honest declaration, not a
    rebuild hazard, and filing it in BLANKET_BASELINE would label it as one.

    So it is allowed here under a condition the corpus can check: the table's
    CREATE carries no ownership-shaped column. The day somebody adds a
