/**
 * The picker must hand back something the upload will actually accept.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * **The defect this pins failed for a real tester on 5 Aug**, on the first
 * genuine end-to-end run of the invoice flow:
 *
 *   > "That did not upload — That file type cannot be read. Use a photo or a
 *   > PDF."
 *
 * The chain broke before the vision model, inside the client's own validation.
 * `iPhones shoot HEIC by default`, and `expo-image-picker` re-encodes most
 * formats but passes HEIC straight through — its own iOS source is explicit:
 *
 *     case UTType.heic.identifier:
 *       return (rawData, ".heic")        // ImageUtils.swift:145
 *
 * The mime type is derived from that extension, so `image/heic` arrived at a
 * check whose allowlist is jpeg/png/webp/pdf, and the upload was refused before
 * a byte left the phone.
 *
 * **It was never a simulator quirk.** Every stock simulator photo is HEIC
 * because every real iPhone photo is. It would have failed for the first person
 * to photograph an invoice.
 *
 * The fix is `preferredAssetRepresentationMode: Compatible`, which asks
 * PHPicker for the most compatible representation — the system transcodes HEIC
 * to JPEG on the device, needing no extra native module and therefore no second
 * cloud build. This file exists so removing that one option fails here rather
 * than in someone's hands.
