/**
 * The product is called **Well Kept**, and this is what stops the old name
 * coming back one call site at a time.
 *
 * ── Why a scanner rather than a checklist ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The 30 Aug rename touched 355 files. A rename that size is not finished when
 * the suites pass — it is finished when nothing can quietly reintroduce the old
 * name, and the failure mode is somebody copying a string from an older file,
 * or a merge landing a branch written before the rename.
 *
 * ⚠ **This scans stripped source, not raw text.** Every exemption below is
 * explained in a comment directly above the line it exempts, so a raw-text
 * scan would pass for a file where somebody deleted the code and left the
 * paragraph — the `.tap-target-44` trap from CLAUDE.md rule 5, which this
 * project has already paid for once.
 *
 * ── The exemptions are the interesting half ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each one names something the rename deliberately did not touch, with the
 * reason. A hit that matches none of them fails, and the fix is either to
 * rename it or to add it here with an argument — which is the point: the list
 * is the record of what "CrewChief" still legitimately means in this tree.
