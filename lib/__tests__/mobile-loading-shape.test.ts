/**
 * `$rules.loadingShape` — a first load is shaped like its content.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── The rule, in the baseline's own words ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * *"Shaped like the content that is coming, not a centred spinner. A blank
 * second on a cold fetch is indistinguishable from broken — and the fetching
 * screens are the ones a reviewer opens first."*
 *
 * `Skeleton` was built for this on 14 August and then adopted by **two** of
 * eight fetching screens. The other six opened as a dot in the middle of an
 * empty field, including vehicle detail — the densest screen in the app and the
 * one a recall notification opens. Found by an external design audit on 16 Aug,
 * not by anything here.
 *
 * ── Why the rule is the *early return*, not the spinner ─────────────────────
 *
 * "No `ActivityIndicator` in a screen" is the rule someone means and it is
 * wrong: a spinner is right for a **job running** — `Button`'s busy state, the
 * invoice scan reading an upload — where there is no shape to promise because
 * nothing is arriving into one.
 *
 * What is decidable, and what the baseline is actually about, is the **initial
 * load**: a `state.kind === 'loading'` early return knows exactly what it is
 * about to render and should stand in for it. That branch is what this checks.

 * and complain; it cannot hide one. A parser that errs toward false positives
 * gets fixed; the other kind gets trusted.
