/**
 * Adding a vehicle photograph from the phone.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── The gap this closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `uploadVehiclePhoto` in `app/actions.ts` is a server action on the cookie
 * session, so a React Native client could never call it. David found the
 * consequence on 15 Aug looking at a garage card: **the identity plate was the
 * only reachable state, and a plate you cannot replace is a dead end rather
 * than a fallback.**
 *
 * Two halves, tested the two ways this repo already tests them. The route is a
 * static read for the reason `create-vehicle-route.test.ts` gives — running it
 * needs a live Supabase, and the properties worth pinning are which helper
 * authorizes and what is refused. The client is executed, because its refusals
 * are the ones an owner will actually meet.

    its action id ships to the browser and it is reachable **without going

    `Blob` and the `upload()` call take `file.type` verbatim. A signed-in owner
    posting an HTML payload with `file.type = 'text/html'` had it stored and
    later served through a signed URL as `Content-Type: text/html` — stored XSS
    on the storage origin, and a permanently broken hero on their own card.
