/**
 * The dashboard tab bar switches sections without re-booting the page.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── Why this file exists, including the part that was wrong ─────────────────
 *
 * 8 Aug: tabs reported unreachable. A hydration race was diagnosed, the tab bar
 * was changed to native `<a>` elements, and a suite called
 * `dashboard-tabs-native.test.ts` was written to pin that.
 *
 * **The diagnosis was an artifact and that suite pinned the wrong thing.** The
 * automated clicks used to "reproduce" the bug were going into a *background*
 * browser tab — `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'` — where a synthetic
 * click does not drive navigation. Every symptom followed from that.
 *
 * The native anchors did make tabs change, but at a cost worse than the
 * original complaint: every switch became a full page load. Measured on
 * production, warm:
 *
 *   - server response for all four routes: **0.4–0.6s TTFB**
 *   - client boot: **~2.7s**, 26 script chunks, paid on *every* switch
 *
 * The server was never slow. The reload was.
 *
 * ── What is pinned now ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Link` transfers only the changed route segment and leaves the shell, nav and
 * vehicle header mounted — the "load the tab's content, not the whole page"
 * behaviour, provided by the framework rather than hand-rolled. `prefetch`
 * fetches that segment during idle time so it is local before the click.
 *
 * The rule is therefore **both**: a `Link`, and an explicit `prefetch`. A
 * `Link` without prefetch still works and is still slower than it needs to be,
 * which is exactly the kind of quiet regression a ratchet is for.
 *
 * ── Why a source scan ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The subject is which component the markup uses and which prop it carries.
 * jsdom has no router, no segment cache and no prefetch, so a rendered test
 * could observe none of it — and the real evidence for the behaviour is a
 * browser measurement, which belongs in the record above rather than in an
 * assertion.
