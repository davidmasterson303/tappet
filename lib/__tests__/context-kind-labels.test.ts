/**
 * Two clients, one set of words for where an answer came from.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * The "Based on" row is a **provenance claim**, and it has been wrong before:
 * `wishlist` and `service` were once collapsed into a single chip, and the app
 * asserted a mod profile for a car that had none. That bug is recorded in
 * `loadedContextKinds`; this file exists so the next version of it fails a test
 * rather than shipping.
 *
 * Phase 3.4 put a second renderer on the same claim — the Expo advisor screen —
 * and a phone and a laptop describing one answer differently is the same defect
 * at two-clients scale, invisible until someone holds them side by side. So the
 * labels moved to `@wellkept/core/consultant-context-kinds` and these are the
 * three things that keep them there.
 *
 * ── Why this is a static scan and not a render test ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Same reasoning as `mobile-api-only.test.ts`: it reads source text, so it
 * needs no React Native runtime and no second toolchain, and it therefore runs
 * on every `npm test` from the day the rule exists rather than from the day
 * someone configures a mobile runner.
