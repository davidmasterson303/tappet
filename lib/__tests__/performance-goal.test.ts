/**
 * The owner's stated performance mindset must actually reach the prompt.
 *
 * ── The bug this pins ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Well Kept has two columns for one concept:
 *
 *   performance_mindedness  enum  stock | mild | aggressive     (owner picks it)
 *   performance_goal        text  mild | moderate | aggressive  (default 'moderate')
 *
 * The owner sets the first in onboarding, and it gates real UI — VehicleInsights
 * hides the mods tab entirely when it is 'stock'. **Nothing in the app ever
 * writes the second.** It has been 'moderate' for every vehicle that has ever
 * existed.
 *
 * `generateModificationDetails` took the owner's real choice as a parameter,
 * `performanceMindset`, and then never referenced it — reading
 * `performance_goal` instead. So an owner who said 'aggressive' received
 * modification analysis written for a 'moderate' owner, an owner who said
 * 'stock' received modification analysis at all, and the two fields appeared to
 * "disagree" when in truth one of them was never consulted.
 *
 * An unused parameter raises no type error and no lint error in this config, so
 * a static check is what catches it coming back.
 *
 * ── And the vocabulary hole underneath it ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 'stock' exists only in the enum; 'moderate' only in the text column. The old
 * lookup table had keys for mild/moderate/aggressive and was indexed with
 * `as keyof typeof` — a cast that silences exactly the error that would have
 * caught 'stock' falling through to `undefined` and being interpolated into a
 * prompt sent to Gemini as the literal string "undefined".
