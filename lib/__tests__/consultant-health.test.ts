/**
 * The round-trip classifier — what blocks a promotion, and what can be waived.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * This is the decision `promote-demo.mjs` acts on, so getting the boundary
 * between `broken` and `degraded` right *is* the feature. `broken` blocks with
 * no override; `degraded` blocks but can be waived on the command line with
 * the reason written into the merge commit.
 *
 * Two assertions here are the ones that matter, and both encode an outage this
 * project actually had:
 *
 *   - A **200 carrying the client's own error string** is `broken`. §25: the
 *     consultant was dead in production while the page returned 200, and every
 *     gate passed. A 200 was treated as proof once already.
 *   - A **200 with a generic answer** is `broken`. "The model replied" and
 *     "the model replied about this car" are different claims, and only the
 *     second means the consultant works.
