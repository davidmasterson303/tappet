/**
 * The privacy manifest has to keep describing the app that ships.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Phase 6, E4. Apple cross-checks `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` against the App
 * Store Connect answers, and a mismatch between them is a rejection that
 * arrives *after* a build has been spent — which on this project means one of
 * fifteen monthly cloud builds.
 *
 * ── Why a declaration needs a guard at all ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A privacy manifest is a **claim about behaviour written in configuration**,
 * which is the shape this repo keeps getting wrong: nothing executes it, no
 * typechecker reads it, and it stays green while the code beneath it moves. The
 * specific decay is one direction — a feature adds a data type and nobody
 * remembers the manifest — so the assertions below are anchored to code and
 * schema, not to the manifest's own contents.
 *
 * ── What this cannot do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It cannot prove the list is *complete*. Proving that would mean deriving
 * Apple's taxonomy from the source, which is a judgement call per column —
 * whether a user-typed ZIP is Coarse Location, whether a VIN is an identifier.
 * Those calls are recorded in `APP_STORE_PRIVACY_ANSWERS_2026-08-12.md` with
 * their reasoning. What this pins is the handful that are unambiguous and the
 * two that would be actively false.
