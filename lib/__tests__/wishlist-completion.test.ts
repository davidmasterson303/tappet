/**
 * Marking a wishlist item done — the only wishlist action that writes history.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * `POST /api/v1/wishlist/complete` inserts a `maintenance_line_items` row and
 * deletes the wishlist entry. There is no undo, and that row is what the
 * advisor, the health score and the service schedule all read afterwards.
 *
 * The route is deliberately forgiving — missing shop becomes `'Unknown'`,
 * missing costs become `0`, missing date becomes today. **Forgiving is right for
 * a route and wrong for a form.** Submitted empty it writes something that looks
 * like a maintenance record and carries nothing, which is the shape this repo
 * already named: a UI implying data it does not have.
