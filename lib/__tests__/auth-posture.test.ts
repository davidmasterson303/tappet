/**
 * Authorization posture — the Phase 0 ratchet.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * The service-role client bypasses RLS completely. Any code path that reaches
 * for it without first proving the caller owns the data is an authorization
 * hole, whether it lives in an API route or a server action. Server actions
 * matter just as much as routes: Next.js compiles them into POST endpoints
 * whose action IDs ship in the client bundle, so they are remotely callable.
 *
 * This suite is a static analysis, not a behavioural test. It exists because
 * every hole found in Phase 0 was invisible to a route-level grep — the worst
 * of them sat inside a server action that an unauthenticated request could
 * still reach.
 *
 * HOW THE RATCHET WORKS
 *   - A new unauthorized service-role caller fails the build immediately.
 *   - Already-known offenders live in PENDING_AUTHORIZATION and are tolerated.
 *   - That list may only ever SHRINK. Fix one, delete its entry. If an entry
 *     is fixed but left in the list, the suite fails too, so it cannot drift
 *     out of date.

    reasoning `/api/health/consultant` is secret-gated precisely because a
    public endpoint that spends tokens on request is the unbounded-cost bug
    this project has already shipped once. That reasoning is right, and it
    does not exempt this route — it sets the bar it has to clear.

    The difference is what the endpoint is *for*, and therefore what the fix

    public, so closing it cost nothing and "cost stops being a design problem
    once the caller must authenticate" was available. This route's entire
    product purpose is that a stranger with no account can use it — that is
    Phase 2.97, and closing it would delete the feature. So the cost problem
    cannot be dissolved by authentication and has to be *carried*, by controls
    built for it:

      - a global daily spend ceiling keyed on surface = 'anonymous', with a
        manual kill switch checked before it (D8, `lib/ai-budget.ts`);
      - per-IP bucketing on the platform-supplied address only, never a
        forwarded header (erratum T1, `packages/core/src/client-ip.ts`);
      - a set thinking level, unlike `parseInvoiceLineItems`, because default
        thinking on an anonymous endpoint is the money faucet 2.95a closed;
      - no dossier generation, ever (D6) — asserted as an absence in
        `front-door-gate.test.ts` and `quote-check.test.ts`;
      - bounded upload size and bounded pasted text.

    'public' is the honest label and it is the uncomfortable one. It is chosen
    over inventing a softer category because the exposure is real and should
    read as real every time someone opens this file. If the controls above are

      ── `secret-gated` is exempt, and this is a deliberate loosening ─────────

      Added 8 Aug for `app/api/internal/notify-sweep`. The rule predates any
      secret-gated route that also needs the service role, and the exemption is
      narrow enough to state precisely:

      **There is no owner to prove.** `PROVES_OWNERSHIP` asks a route to show it
      resolved *a user* before reaching a client that bypasses RLS. A secret-
      gated route has no user — nothing triggered the sweep but the clock — so
      the assertion is not "weak" here, it is unanswerable. Passing it would
      require inventing a session, which is worse than exempting it.

      **The authorization it does have is checked harder than this.** The
      `actually gates on a secret` case above demands the route read the secret
      from the environment, compare what the caller presented, *and fail closed
      when it is unset*. `public` — which was already exempt — is checked by
      nothing at all. So this exemption is strictly stronger than the one it
      sits beside.

      **The bar it must clear.** Do not read this as "secret-gated routes are
      trusted". It is the reason `notify-sweep-route.test.ts` exists as a
      separate suite: constant-time comparison, fail-closed on an unset secret,
      POST only, no user credential accepted, and a bounded blast radius. A new
      secret-gated route reaching the service role needs the same, and adding
      one here without it is how this exemption becomes the hole.
