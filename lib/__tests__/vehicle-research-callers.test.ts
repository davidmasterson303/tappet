/**
 * The caller list for the one function in this app that spends money without
 * authorizing anything.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * `lib/vehicle-research.ts` exports `researchVehicleDossier`, which makes a
 * Pro-model call — up to three attempts — and writes to
 * `vehicle_knowledge_base` for whatever vehicle it is handed. It performs **no
 * session check, no ownership check and no rate limit.** That is deliberate:
 * its two callers authorize in two incompatible ways, and pushing the check
 * inside would mean the sweep could not use it at all.
 *
 * ── Why a test rather than a comment ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The docblock on that function says loudly that every caller must authorize
 * first. A docblock is advice; this is the ratchet. The specific accident it
 * pins is a third caller appearing on a route that forgot — which would not
 * fail to compile, would not fail any other suite, and would present as a
 * working feature right up until somebody noticed the bill or the write.
 *
 * ── Why it is static analysis ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The property is *which files reference the symbol*, which is a fact about
 * the source tree. Importing the module proves nothing about who else imports
 * it, and there is no runtime moment at which "only these two callers exist"
 * is observable.
