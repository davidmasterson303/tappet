/**
 * `$rules.noShadowedPrimitives` — nothing may be named after a primitive it is
 * not.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── The pattern, three times ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A private copy of a primitive is easy to spot when it is called
 * `emptyBlock`. One wearing the primitive's **own name** is invisible: it reads
 * as adoption, so an audit walks past it and the import it shadows is never
 * reached for.
 *
 * It cost three audits before it was named:
 *
 *   - `AdvisorScreen` defined `function EmptyState()` — which is why
 *     `EmptyState` reached 16 Aug with **zero callers** while four screens
 *     rolled their own.
 *   - `MarkDoneSheet` defined `function Field()` — the last screen in the app
 *     with no primitives, and the reason was sitting in its own file.
 *   - Four screens carried a style literally named `card` on the wrong ladder
 *     step. Same family, different mechanism, already guarded by
 *     `mobile-surface-ladder.test.ts`.
 *
 * ── The rule, and why it is a name check rather than a shape check ──────────
 *
 * "Do not reimplement a primitive" is not decidable from source — plenty of
 * local components legitimately resemble one. **A name collision is.** And it
 * is the collision, not the resemblance, that does the damage: `FieldGroup`
 * next to `Field` is honest and reviewable; a second `Field` is camouflage.
 *
 * So a local component may be as similar as it likes, provided it is not
 * lying about which one it is.

      The link is honest about being indirect. This rule is about **names**, and
      there is no plain-TypeScript module that holds them — every primitive is a
      `.tsx` that cannot be imported in a node environment. So it anchors to the
      layer those primitives are built from, exactly as the sibling static
      guards do. If `apps/mobile/src/theme` ever moved, this fails loudly rather

      and this suite still exercises shipped code rather than only reading it.
