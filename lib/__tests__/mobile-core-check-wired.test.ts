/**
 * The on-device core probe is actually rendered, and stays out of release.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * `checkSharedCore()` calls real `@wellkept/core` code with known inputs
 * inside the React Native runtime and asserts known outputs. It is the only
 * check that can catch core relying on something the phone's engine does not
 * have — and it spent from Phase 3.2 until 5 Aug **exported and imported by
 * nothing**, because `GarageScreen` replaced the `SignedInScreen` that used to
 * render it and nothing failed when its only caller disappeared.
 *
 * That is the failure this file pins. A probe that is not rendered is not a
 * probe, and nothing about deleting its last import is loud.
 *
 * ── What it catches that `portability.test.ts` cannot ───────────────────────
 *
 * That suite walks `packages/core/src` transitively for disqualifying imports
 * — `next/*`, `@supabase/*`, `node:*`, browser globals — and is better at that
 * job than the device probe is. But **a runtime capability is not an import**:
 *
 *   - `formatting-utils.ts` calls `Intl.NumberFormat` and `toLocaleString`.
 *     A Hermes built without Intl returns unseparated digits rather than
 *     throwing, so the garage would quietly read "94800 mi".
 *   - `consultant-context-kinds.ts` calls `Object.hasOwn` (ES2022, added
 *     5 Aug). Node has it, so Jest can never fail on it.
 *
 * Neither appears in any import list. The two suites are complementary: the
 * Node one proves core *may* load on the phone, the device one proves it
 * *works* there.
 *
 * ── Why a source scan ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same constraint as `mobile-api-only.test.ts`: the subject is React Native
 * source this runner cannot load, and the property — *is it wired in, is it
 * gated* — is structural.
