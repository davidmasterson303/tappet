/**
 * Traffic class — the column that decides which rows a price is derived from.
 *
 * `purpose` says which feature spent the money. `surface` says whose traffic it
 * was, and only `account` belongs in the D2 dataset. Getting this wrong is not
 * a reporting inconvenience: it is a subscription price derived partly from a
 * robot and partly from a demo garage nobody will ever pay for.
 *
 * The measurement that forced this column into existence rather than letting it
 * ride with Phase 2.97, from the first eight live rows:
 *
 *   canary (health check)   5 rows   ~40 visible tokens/call   7.34x thinking
 *   consultant (demo)       3 rows  ~127 visible tokens/call   1.39x thinking
 *   ── blended ──                                              3.45x
 *
 * The blend describes neither path. It was read as evidence that Phase 2.95a
 * had only half landed; it had fully landed, and user traffic was at 1.39x the
 * whole time. **An average across two populations is not a measurement of
 * either**, and separating them at write time is the only fix — by the time the
 * fortnight of data exists, the rows are already written.
 *
 * Every assertion runs against the migration with its prose stripped, for the
 * reason `ai-usage.test.ts` records: a check that reads documentation can be
 * turned green by editing a sentence.
