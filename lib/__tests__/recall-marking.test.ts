/**
 * Marking a recall repaired.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── What is worth asserting about this route ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not that an upsert calls `upsert`. Three things, and each of them is a
 * decision somebody could reasonably reverse without noticing what it cost:
 *
 *   - **Authorization runs before anything is read from the body**, and a demo
 *     vehicle cannot be written to. This is the one route in the product where
 *     a write is a claim about a safety defect.
 *   - **The date is the server's.** A body-supplied `addressedAt` would let a
 *     phone with a wrong clock stamp "repaired in 2019" onto a 2024 campaign.
 *   - **`DELETE` exists and works.** A claim an owner can make and cannot
 *     unmake is a trap, and this is the tap most worth being able to undo.
 *
 * The campaign-number check gets its own block because it is the one string a
 * client controls that reaches a `TEXT` column with a `UNIQUE` constraint.
