/**
 * `$rules.surfaceLadder` — a card is `Card`, on the ladder's card step.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── The drift this closes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On 15 August four screens — recalls, service history, the service milestone
 * and the wishlist — each carried a **private copy** of the card: a style
 * literally named `card`, painted on `surface.raised`, with no border. The
 * `Card` primitive is `surface.card` with `border.panel`.
 *
 * `raised` is the ladder's step for **bars, tab strips and chips**. A card
 * painted on it sits one step off from every other card in the app, so the same
 * object rendered differently depending on which screen you were on — which is
 * exactly the "twelve slightly different containers" `Card` was written to end,
 * surviving inside the very screens that were supposed to adopt it.
 *
 * ── Why the rule is this narrow ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Card-shaped containers must use the primitive" is the rule people mean and
 * it is not decidable from source — a `View` with a background and a radius
 * might legitimately be a chip, a sheet or a banner.
 *
 * What *is* decidable is the contradiction: a container carrying the **card
 * radius** on the **bar surface** is on two different steps at once, and there
 * is no reading of the token layer where that is intended. That is the shape
 * all four violations had, and it is the one this asserts.
 *
 * Same discipline as `mobile-radius-scale.test.ts`: a rule narrow enough to be
 * decidable, rather than a broad one people learn to route around.
