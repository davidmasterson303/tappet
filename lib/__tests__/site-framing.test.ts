/**
 * Telling the demo host from the product host, from what it serves.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── Why this is a pure function with a test ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Same argument as `run-outcome.test.ts`: the behaviour lives inside a promote
 * script, so running that script against a healthy target proves nothing about
 * what it would do against a sick one. Confirming the check fired at all
 * required temporarily repointing the demo URL at the product host — which
 * works once and is not a test anybody runs twice.
 *
 * ── What it is guarding ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `CREWCHIEF_DEMO_SITE` is a per-site Netlify variable. Since 22 Aug the demo
 * masthead **and** the landing call to action are both gated on it, and its
 * default is product — chosen so an unset variable can never put demo framing
 * on the App Store listing's URL, which is the failure that actually happened
 * with the masthead on 20 Aug.
 *
 * ⚠ The cost of that safe direction lands on the other host. A demo site whose
 * variable goes missing does not break, error or look wrong: it quietly starts
 * asking recruiters to **sign up**. `promote-demo` now refuses rather than
 * shipping that, and this pins the decision it refuses on.
