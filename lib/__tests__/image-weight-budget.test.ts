/**
 * Per-surface image weight, held as a number rather than a habit.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * `docs/roadmap.md` item 15: "budgets in CI, not vigilance", so that an
 * F2/F3-class regression can never ship silently again. Those two findings are
 * worth restating, because this file's thresholds are aimed at exactly them:
 *
 *   - **F2** — five auth screens backgrounded a 480 KB JPEG behind a scrim at
 *     0.6–0.85 alpha. Nobody noticed for months, because a heavy background is
 *     invisible on a fast connection and the page looked right.
 *   - **F3** — every photograph shipped as JPEG only, at fixed sizes, with the
 *     Next optimizer switched off.
 *
 * Both are now fixed, and both would be re-introduced by an ordinary-looking
 * edit: one `backgroundImage: url(...)` on a login page, or one new photograph
 * committed without derivatives. Neither shows up in a typecheck, a unit test,
 * or a screenshot.
 *
 * ── Why this is a source/asset check and not Lighthouse ─────────────────────
 *
 * The item asks for LCP and CLS as well. Those need a real browser against a
 * deployed URL, which is a different kind of check with a different failure
 * mode — it is slow, it is flaky on a cold Netlify function, and a red build
 * from a noisy metric teaches people to re-run until green. What is here
 * instead is deterministic: it reads the repo, so it cannot flake, and it
 * catches the specific regressions the audit actually found. LCP/CLS is left
 * as a genuine gap rather than papered over with something unreliable.
