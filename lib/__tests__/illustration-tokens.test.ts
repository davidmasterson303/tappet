/**
 * Colour conformance for the vehicle illustration set.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * A ratchet, in the same spirit as `internal-fetch-posture`: static analysis
 * over the source, with an allowlist that may only shrink. The review feedback
 * asks for a guard so literal colours "can't come back", and the reason they
 * must not is specific — these twelve shapes are the fallback that appears when
 * a user has no photo, so they render on every surface in the app. A hex here
 * survives a theme change and a hard-coded warm tint is exactly the drift this
 * set was accused of.
 *
 * The rules being enforced, all four from §4:
 *   1. No literal colour values at all — every fill and stroke via a token.
 *   2. No cyan: `--primary`, `--accent`, `--ring` are reserved for actions.
 *   3. No health-ramp tokens: `--ring-good|ok|warn|bad` mean a score.
 *   4. No semantic families: confirm/attention/critical mean status.

      ⚠ Tightened 17 Aug, and the old assertion is why this comment is long.

      It used to pin the tint as `fill={tint} opacity={…}` at ≤0.3 — a fill,
      merely a faint one. Design's capture review rejected that shape outright:
      **"Light, never fill — the hue may not carry a health value."**

      The distinction is not stylistic. A filled body is a *coloured object*,
      and a coloured object on a surface that also carries a health ramp invites
      the colour to be read as a reading. A rim leaves the body graphite and
      puts the hue where a light source would.

      So the rule is now the stronger one: the hue reaches the body as a
      **stroke** and `fill={tint}` may not appear at all. The previous test
      would have passed on any faint fill forever, because it was written to
      describe the implementation rather than the rule.
