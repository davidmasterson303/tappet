/**
 * The status family and the health ramp are never the same colour.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── The rule, and Design's reason for it ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `tokens.json` carries `$rules.semanticsAreNotShared`, and until 23 Aug 2026
 * this repository violated it while carrying a docblock claiming it did not.
 * `status.attention` was `#E0A468` — **the health ramp's `warn` hex** — and
 * `status.critical` was `#E08882`, its `bad`. The comment above them said they
 * "happen to share hues with two bands"; they did not share hues, they were the
 * same value.
 *
 * Design's ruling, in their words: the two families are meant to **rhyme
 * without matching**, because *a gauge reading and a status chip are different
 * claims, and sharing a colour makes a 61 look like something you can dismiss.*
 *
 * The garage bay had exactly that on screen — a dial reading in warn amber,
 * with a recall chip beside it in the same amber the dial uses for Critical.
 *
 * ── Why a test rather than a note ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because a note is what failed. The rule was written down in the token file,
 * and the docblock sitting directly above the offending values asserted
 * compliance with it — so every reader who checked stopped there. The system's
 * own adherence spec makes this argument: *"a rule a build enforces is a rule;
 * a rule a person has to remember is a preference with good intentions."*
 *
 * ⚠ This does **not** check any value against the design system export. It
 * cannot: the export is a zip in someone's Downloads, and the copy this repo
 * was last shown stamped `$meta.version` 6.0.0 while Design had shipped 8.1.0.
 * What it checks is the *invariant* — an equality that is wrong whatever the
 * two ramps currently hold — which is the half that stays true across exports.

 * Every hex the health ramp can paint, sampled through the public API.

 * the better route anyway: it is the function every client actually calls, so a
 * change to how a band stores its colour moves this check with it instead of
 * leaving it comparing against a shape nothing renders.
 *
 * One score per band, the same four `contrast.test.tsx` uses. `name` comes back
 * on the judgement, so a fifth band added later shows up as an unnamed entry
 * rather than being silently skipped — see the count assertion below.
