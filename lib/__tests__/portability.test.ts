 * share. Its done-condition is that **no module in that package imports
 * `next/*`, `@supabase/*` or a Node built-in** — and that this is asserted as
 * a test rather than kept as a review habit, "because it is exactly the kind
 * of thing that decays silently".
 *
 * The assertion landed before the move rather than after it, which is why the
 * move itself was mechanical. **It is now doing the opposite job**: `PORTABLE`
 * is empty because everything that qualified has gone, so the load-bearing
 * assertions are the two that guard the result — every module now inside
 * `packages/core/src` is still portable, and every module left in `lib/` is
 * still genuinely blocked. The first is where a later edit would reintroduce a
 * Supabase import into the shared package unnoticed.
 *
 * **The check is transitive**, which is the whole point. `account-data.ts`
 * imports nothing disqualifying by eye — it reaches `@supabase/supabase-js`
 * through `lib/supabase.ts`, two hops down. A direct-import grep says it is
 * portable and is wrong.
