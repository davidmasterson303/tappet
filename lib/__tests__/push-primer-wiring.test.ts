/**
 * The primer's rule is right; this asserts the app actually obeys it.

 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Phase 5, C5. `push-priming.test.ts` proves *when* to ask. It would stay green
 * against an app that ignored the answer entirely — which is the exact failure
 * this repo has recorded before: eleven green tests in `security.test.ts`
 * asserting protection the exported middleware did not have.
 *
 * The property here is a wiring one — which module calls what, and in what
 * order — so it is a source scan. React Native cannot be rendered by this
 * runner, and the one thing that matters most (that iOS's dialog is not raised
 * uninvited) is not observable at runtime on any machine we have.
