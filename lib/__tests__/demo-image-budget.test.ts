/**
 * The garage grid's image payload has a budget, and this holds it.
 *
 * CC-142's acceptance criteria include "garage grid total image payload under
 * 250 KB with all three demo vehicles photographed." Before the derivatives it
 * was **2,252 KB** — three page-width heroes fetched to fill three ~400px
 * boxes, which is roughly a tenth of each file doing any work.
 *
 * This is a ratchet rather than documentation because the regression is
 * invisible in every way that usually catches things. Pointing DEMO_IMAGES back
 * at `hero-3x2.jpg` renders *identically* — same photograph, same crop, same
 * layout — and costs 2 MB. Nothing about the page looks wrong, no test of
 * behaviour fails, and on a development machine it is not even slow.
 *
 * The likeliest way it comes back is someone deleting the DEMO_IMAGES map, as
 * its own comment invites, and letting the card fall through to
 * `vehicles.image_url` — which holds the hero. That is a correct-looking
 * cleanup with a 10x payload cost, so it fails here instead.
