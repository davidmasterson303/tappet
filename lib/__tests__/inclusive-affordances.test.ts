/**
 * `$rules.inclusiveAffordances` — the work that only exists for people you are not.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── Why these three, out of nine ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The roadmap keeps a list headed **"Already right — do not regress these"** —
 * nine deliberate pieces of responsive and accessibility work, each with a
 * reason written beside it. All nine were verified present on 17 Aug. Only
 * three are guarded here, and the filter is not importance:
 *
 * **A regression in these three is invisible to the person causing it.**
 *
 * Nobody develops in Windows High Contrast. Nobody develops with a coarse
 * pointer. So a rename that unhooks the forced-colors block, or a refactor that
 * drops the focus path from a hover-revealed control, produces a diff that
 * looks clean, a page that looks right, and a product that has quietly stopped
 * working for someone. The other six regress in front of you the moment you
 * resize a window, and a test is the wrong tool for those.
 *
 * ── The failure that motivates the first one, stated exactly ────────────────
 *
 * Forced colors overrides SVG `fill` and `stroke` as well as text and
 * background. Before item 17, every part of the cluster dial — unlit track, lit
 * arc, needle, ticks — resolved to one CanvasText. `globals.css` puts it well:
 * *"The gauge does not break, it does something worse: it still looks like a
 * gauge while showing a full ring at every score."*
 *
 * A dial that reads 100 for a car scoring 40 is not a degraded dial.
