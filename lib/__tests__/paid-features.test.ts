 *
 * ── The pricing decision of 24 Aug ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The paid tier used to be a larger token allowance and the paywall sold that
 * difference in words. Three things were wrong with it and they compounded: the
 * unit was one the customer had never seen, the multiple stated was wrong
 * (IAP-06 — "five times" against a real 2.5×), and both tiers could reach every
 * expensive path so price and cost were unconnected.
 *
 * ── ⚠ What this suite is really guarding ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not the arithmetic — there is none left. It guards two things that would be
 * expensive to get wrong and silent when they were:
 *
 *   1. **The gate defaults to off.** Enforcing before E8 lands takes three
 *      features from every existing account with no way to buy them back.
 *   2. **The paywall's promise and the server's gate are one list.** A
 *      hand-written list on a paywall is a second source of truth for what
 *      somebody just paid for, and the copy is the half the customer read.

      feature is served — and nothing in the type system or the copy notices
      the difference. The result is a product that charges for something it

      `recalls` moved to paid on 30 Aug and is exactly that today. It is listed
      rather than quietly tolerated: the entry has to be deleted when the gate
      lands, and until then this test is where somebody finds out.
