 * David, 30 Aug: *"some combo of pricing and LLM call budget that will prevent
 * me from losing money on any users… designing a model where worst case
 * customer usage is breakeven is ok with me."*
 *
 * ── ⛔ This suite currently pins a gap rather than a guarantee ───────────────
 *
 * The requirement is not met today, and that is the honest state of it. The
 * paid ceiling is 1,000,000 output-equivalent tokens, which costs about $10 at
 * the most expensive rate a metered path can reach, against $2.83 of net
 * revenue from the worst-paying plan. **3.5× the revenue it protects.**
 *
 * The derived ceiling — the one that makes the worst month cost exactly what
 * the worst plan earns — is about 283,000. It is not applied, and the blocker
 * is ordering rather than arithmetic: it is *below* the 400,000 free ceiling,
 * so applying it would make the paid tier smaller than the free one. That is
 * not a rounding problem, it is the tiers telling you the free allowance is
 * bigger than a subscription can pay for.
 *
 * So this file does two jobs. It asserts the model is arithmetically right —
 * which plan binds, what the ceiling would be, that the ordering works once the
 * gate is enforced — and it **pins the gap**, so the distance between what is
 * shipped and what was asked for cannot widen while nobody is looking.
 *
 * ⚠ The pinned numbers below are meant to be edited. When David sets a price,
 * enforces the gate, or the dossier's thinking level comes down, these fail —
 * and that failure is the point at which somebody reads the sentence above and
 * decides deliberately.
