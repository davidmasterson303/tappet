/**
 * Every environment variable the code reads must be documented in .env.example.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Found by audit on 27 Jul: the code had been reading
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` and
 * `CREWCHIEF_CI_URL` for some time while `.env.example` listed none of them.
 *
 * That failure mode is quiet and expensive. A missing key does not break the
 * build — it breaks at runtime, in the deployment, usually as a feature that
 * silently returns nothing. This session already spent real time on two of
 * them: a dead deployed service-role key, and an expired
 * `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` that made vehicle image lookup fail without an error.
 * `.env.example` is the only checklist that exists for a fresh clone or a new
 * Netlify environment, so it drifting is a deployment hazard rather than a
 * documentation nit.
