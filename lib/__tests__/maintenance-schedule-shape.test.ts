/**
 * A maintenance interval has to be comparable to an odometer reading.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * `MaintenanceScheduleItem` in `packages/core/src/types.ts` has declared
 * `interval_miles: number` since the type was written, and **nothing ever
 * produced it** — the research prompt emitted `{item, interval: "every 30,000
 * miles"}` and `app/actions.ts` reconciled the two with `item.item ||
 * item.service`. A type describing a contract nothing satisfies is the same
 * failure as `build_assets.py`, referenced everywhere and never committed.
 *
 * Phase 5's service-due notification is what makes it matter: prose cannot be
 * compared to a number, so a schedule of prose cannot tell anyone their car
 * needs work. This file holds the shape that fixed it.
 *
 * Two properties here are load-bearing and neither is obvious:
 *
 *   1. **A bad entry costs one entry, not the knowledge base.** This schema
 *      guards onboarding. `parse` throws on the whole object, so strict
 *      validation of a hallucinated interval would fail a new user's first
 *      screen entirely.
 *   2. **A legacy prose entry is dropped, not parsed.** Guessing a number out
 *      of "every 2 years or 24k" would be right most of the time, and most of
 *      the time is the wrong standard for telling someone to spend money.
