/**
 * The anonymous front door's abuse controls. Phase 2.97a, decision D8.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Three controls, in this order of authority: the daily spend ceiling with its
 * kill switch (primary), per-IP bucketing on a platform-supplied address
 * (secondary), and no dossier generation on this path ever (D6).
 *
 * The ordering is erratum **T1** and it is the substance rather than the
 * presentation. The original 2.97a wording named IP bucketing primary;
 * `cc-tech-0003` at high confidence forbids exactly that, because a bucket
 * keyed on a caller-supplied header counts to one forever while reporting that
 * it works. Most of what is asserted below is that the *unsound* control cannot
 * quietly become the load-bearing one.
