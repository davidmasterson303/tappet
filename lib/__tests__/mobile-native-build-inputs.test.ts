/**
 * What has to be true *before* a cloud build is spent.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * The Expo client is compiled on EAS because this Mac cannot build it, and the
 * free plan allows **15 iOS builds a month**. Ordinary JavaScript changes cost
 * none — the development build loads them from Metro. A **native module** costs
 * one, because native code has to be compiled in before it can run at all.
 *
 * That makes two mistakes expensive in a way nothing else in this repo is:
 *
 *   1. **Adding native modules one at a time.** Two modules added in two
 *      commits are two builds. Camera (Phase 4) and push notifications
 *      (Phase 5) were deliberately installed together on 5 Aug for this reason.
 *   2. **Shipping a native module without its iOS usage description.** iOS
 *      terminates the app the moment a permission is requested without one, and
 *      App Store review rejects the binary. Neither is visible until the build
 *      exists — so the check would otherwise arrive one build too late.
 *
 * The second is the one this file mostly exists for. It is the same shape as
 * the `eas.json` defect recorded in `apps/mobile/EAS_CONFIG_NOTES.md`: a config
 * committed without ever being executed, whose error surfaced on first use.
