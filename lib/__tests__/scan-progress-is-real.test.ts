/**
 * The invoice scanner narrates work it actually did — UX-15, handoff §1.4.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── What shipped, and why nothing caught it ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `InvoiceProcessingLoader` took one boolean and ran its own `setInterval` over
 * four hard-coded stages, advancing with `(prev + 1) % steps.length`.
 *
 * The modulo is the part worth remembering. It **wrapped**: any upload slower
 * than 8.5 seconds ticked "Processing line items" complete with a green check,
 * then began "Uploading file" again — so a user watching a slow scan saw the
 * work finish two or three times. Nothing displayed was ever observed, and no
 * test could have caught it, because the component was internally consistent.
 * It was a correct implementation of a lie.
 *
 * ── ⚠ The fix was not to delete the beat ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `CODE_HANDOFF_2026-08-24.md` §1.4 is explicit, and it corrects an earlier
 * reading of this decision: *"not to remove the beat but to make it narrate
 * something real — count up the records actually read, name the file being
 * parsed, show the fields extracted as they land. Same reassurance, no
 * fiction."*
 *
 * So these tests are not "assert the animation is gone". They assert that every
 * figure shown is one the client genuinely holds, and that where it holds none,
 * nothing is shown rather than a timer.
