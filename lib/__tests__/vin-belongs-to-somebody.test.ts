/**
 * A VIN that is already registered belongs to somebody, and it matters who.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── The dead end this is written against ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Found 22 Aug by entering a VIN another account already held. The screen said
 * **"This vehicle is already in your garage"**, waited two seconds, and then
 * **bounced to the garage with no message at all**.
 *
 * The lookup ran on the service-role client with no `user_id` filter, so it
 * searched every account — and `vehicles.vin` is `UNIQUE` across the table, so
 * the row it found was as likely to be a stranger's as the caller's. It then
 * returned that stranger's `vehicleId`, which the form navigates to.
 *
 * ⚠ **Authorization held.** `authorizeVehicleAccess` refused the dashboard,
 * which is why the user landed back at the garage and why nothing leaked. The
 * bounce was the last line of defence doing its job about a journey that
 * should never have started. Nothing here weakens that check; the fix is two
 * layers earlier, where the wrong vehicle was chosen.
