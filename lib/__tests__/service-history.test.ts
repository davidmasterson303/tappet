/**
 * History becomes a baseline, or honestly becomes nothing.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Track A2a. `evaluateSchedule` has accepted history lookups since it was
 * written and nothing ever passed any, so every service on the milestone screen
 * has been either `unknown` or estimated from the odometer. This suite drives
 * the adapter that closes that, and most of it is about the ways a wrong
 * baseline is worse than none:
 *
 *   - claiming a service was done *now* because no mileage was recorded
 *   - letting an undated scrap displace a fully recorded service
 *   - calling a recollection a record
 *   - matching "brake fluid" to "brake inspection" on the word "brake"
 *
 * Each of those produces a confident, wrong "nothing due" — the failure mode
 * `service-due.ts` names in its own header as the fastest way to teach someone
 * the alerts are noise.
