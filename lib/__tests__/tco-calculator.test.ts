/**
 * TCO math — against the shipped implementation.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * This suite had **no imports**. It defined its own `estimateResaleValue` and
 * `calculateTCO` at the top of the file and tested those, while the real math
 * shipped from inside `components/TCOCard.tsx`. Its own header said it covered
 * "the core math extracted from TCOCard" — extracted meaning copied.
 *
 * The copies diverged. The aggregation stayed identical line for line, but the
 * depreciation model became a different model entirely: a lookup table here
 * (0.80 at one year, 0.20 floor) against exponential decay there (0.85^age,
 * 0.08 floor). So every green assertion below was computed on a resale curve
 * the product never used.
 *
 * Third instance of the pattern in this repo, after `security.test.ts` testing
 * a private `runMiddlewareLogic()` against a no-op middleware, and
 * `rls-ownership.test.ts` testing a `mockVehicleDb` simulation. The fix is the
 * same each time: one implementation, imported.
 *
 * Most of the assertions here were also self-referential — `expect(depreciation)
 * .toBe(40000 - result.resaleValue)` restates the implementation and passes
 * against any curve at all. That is why the divergence was survivable for so
 * long. The `the shipped depreciation curve` block at the end exists to fix
 * that: it pins actual numbers, so a change to the model has to be deliberate.
