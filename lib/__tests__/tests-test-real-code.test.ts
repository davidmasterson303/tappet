 * This repo's signature failure, three times over:
 *
 *   - `security.test.ts` defined its own `runMiddlewareLogic()` and tested
 *     that, while the exported middleware was a no-op with an empty matcher.
 *     11 green tests asserting protection the app did not have.
 *   - `rls-ownership.test.ts` tests a `mockVehicleDb` and `simulate*` helpers
 *     defined in its own file. It was titled "RLS Ownership Verification"
 *     while the `vehicles` table's real policies were `USING (true)`.
 *   - `tco-calculator.test.ts` defined its own `calculateTCO` and
 *     `estimateResaleValue` while the shipped math lived in a component. The
 *     two copies drifted into different depreciation models and the suite
 *     stayed green for months.
 *
 * Each was found by hand, long after the fact. The rule that would have caught
 * all three is one line: **a test that imports nothing is testing itself.**
 *
 * Phase 2.4 asked for a sweep for a third instance. This is that sweep, made
 * permanent — moving files between packages is exactly when a test quietly
 * stops pointing at the thing it names, so the guard matters more during the
 * shared-package work than it did before it.
