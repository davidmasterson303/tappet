/**
 * Deadlines on outbound calls.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Written for the onboarding hang: the Gemini research call and the vehicle
 * image lookup both had **no timeout at all**, so a slow upstream left a user
 * on a spinner with no error, no completion and no way forward. A wait you
 * cannot bound is a hang, not a wait — and this is the first thing a new user
 * does, including an App Store reviewer.
