/**
 * What a service-history row claims, and on whose word.

 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * A history list is where provenance stops being an abstraction: four rows in
 * one column, identical in weight, read as four equally solid facts. One of
 * them may be a recollection given on a sign-up screen.
 *
 * `20260808150000` added `'owner-onboarding'` rather than reusing `'manual'`
 * for exactly this reason — *"An invoice is evidence. 'I think it was around
 * 85,000' is a recollection."* These tests are that distinction surviving
 * contact with a UI.
