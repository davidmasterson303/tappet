/**
 * Session expiry returns you to /login. Being anonymous does not.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Task 1.6's second done-condition, and the whole difficulty is in the
 * negative case. Supabase reports "no session" to an anonymous visitor on
 * every page load, so a listener that reads "no session" as "session expired"
 * redirects every recruiter browsing the public demo to a login page. §3 item
 * 6 records route protection doing exactly that once already; the demo is
 * linked from David's portfolio during an active job search.
 *
 * So these tests are mostly about what must *not* happen.
