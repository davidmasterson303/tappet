/**
 * `$rules.radiusScale` — no raw corner radius in `apps/mobile`.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it is radius and not all geometry ──────────────
 *
 * The token layer says it plainly: **"9, 10 and 16 do not exist."** On 15 August
 * `borderRadius: 10` appeared at **nine** sites and `16` at one, alongside
 * twenty-eight more written as bare `12`, `14` and `20` — on-scale by luck
 * rather than by reference.
 *
 * That is the same failure `mobile-color-literals.test.ts` was written for, one
 * property along, and §0.16's argument applies unchanged: *a token layer nothing
 * is obliged to use is documentation, not a system.* Step 1 removed 232 colour
 * literals and left the geometry alone, so radius went on drifting quietly —
 * every screen a slightly different card.
 *
 * ⚠ **Radius only, deliberately.** The same scan finds ~60 off-scale paddings
 * and gaps, and most of them are not defects: a 2pt gap between a title and its
 * subtitle is an optical hairline, not a spacing step, and a rule that flagged
 * it would be trained around within a week. Radius is a **closed set** the theme
 * enumerates, which makes the rule decidable. The spacing scale wants its own
 * pass with a designer's eye, not a regex.
