/**
 * The order the anonymous front door's controls run in. Phase 2.97a/b.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Erratum T1 did not add a control — it **reordered** two that both already
 * existed, and the reorder was the entire finding. That makes ordering the
 * thing under test here, because an ordering is exactly what survives review
 * and dies in implementation: every check is present, the diff looks complete,
 * and the wrong one is load-bearing.
 *
 * Most assertions below would still pass if the checks ran in any order. The
 * ones that would not are marked, and they are the reason this file exists.

    middleware runs.** During a prefetch-shaped request `handleFrontDoor`
    receives `accept`, `host` and `user-agent` and nothing else. A Next `<Link>`
    prefetch is a client `fetch()` that carries no browser prefetch header
    either, so from middleware it is indistinguishable from a person arriving.

    `isPrefetchRequest` still passes its own suite — it is correct, and it works
    in the route handler and against browser speculative loads. It simply cannot
    fire in the one position that mints visitor ids. That gap is closed here,
    at the only other place it can be: the links themselves.

    Without this, adding a nav link to the front door would silently inflate
    `landed` with everyone who merely saw the link, and every conversion rate
    below it would be divided by a made-up number — invisibly, and in the
