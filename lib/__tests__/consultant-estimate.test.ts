 *
 * Not "does the regex work". The estimate is the one place in this product
 * where a language model's output is rendered **as prices, in the product's own
 * voice, inside a styled panel** — which is the strongest claim of precision
 * anything here makes. Every test below is about a way that claim could become
 * untrue: a range too tight to be honest, a total invented by addition, a well
 * that renders at $0 on an answer that priced nothing.
 *
 * The parsing is the easy half and it is covered because it has to be. The
 * judgements are the half worth reading.
