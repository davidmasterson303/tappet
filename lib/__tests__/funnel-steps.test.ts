/**
 * The front door's funnel — the vocabulary, the ranking, and the schema posture.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Phase 2.97d. The database write is fire-and-forget and is not tested here,
 * for the reason `ai-usage.test.ts` gives: it cannot throw, so a rejected INSERT
 * is a warn line and a missing row, and the first symptom is a funnel that is
 * quietly incomplete. There is no runtime signal. A build-time one is the only
 * kind available.
 *
 * What is tested is the part that fails without failing — a step the
 * application knows and the CHECK refuses, a visitor id that collapses every
 * visitor into one, and a counts function that reports more people answered
 * than uploaded.
 *
 * Every schema assertion runs against the migration with its prose stripped.
 * A check that reads documentation can be turned green by editing a sentence.
