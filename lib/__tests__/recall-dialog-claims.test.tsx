/**
 * The dialog behind the recall tile, rendered.
 *
 * ── The defect, and why a scan was not enough ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `HealthSummary` computes the three-state recall claim correctly and renders
 * a grey question mark with "We have not checked this vehicle for recalls
 * yet… This is not a clear result."
 *
 * **That tile is this dialog's trigger.** So an owner read the honest hedge,
 * clicked it to find out more, and arrived at a green icon, "No recalls to
 * date", and "This vehicle has a clean safety record" — for a vehicle whose
 * NHTSA record had never been fetched.
 *
 * ⚠ The component received only `recalls: any[]`, so it was **structurally
 * incapable** of telling "checked, none found" from "never checked". The fix
 * was to pass the evidence, not to reword the copy.
 *
 * `absence-is-not-an-all-clear.test.ts` catches a file that states a clean
 * result without the rule in scope. It cannot catch a file that imports the
 * rule and renders the wrong branch anyway — which is what this covers.
