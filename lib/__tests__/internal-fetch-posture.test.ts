/**
 * No route may send a user's credentials to an address it derived from the
 * request.
 *
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * A ratchet, in the shape of `auth-posture.test.ts`, and it exists because of
 * one concrete instance. `app/api/v1/wishlist/complete/route.ts` (then at `app/api/wishlist/complete`) recomputed
 * performance stats by POSTing to
 * `${request.nextUrl.origin}/api/performance-stats` with the caller's session
 * cookie attached, so the inner route could authorize the hop.
 *
 * `nextUrl.origin` is derived from the incoming request's host headers. That
 * made the destination of a request carrying a live session cookie a function
 * of a header the caller influences, and of whether the platform in front of
 * the app normalises it. It may have been safe on Netlify. The problem is
 * that its safety was a property of someone else's proxy configuration rather
 * than of this codebase — nothing here could assert it, and it could stop
 * being true without a line of this repo changing.
 *
 * The fix was to delete the hop: `lib/performance-stats.ts` is now called in
 * process with the client the caller already authorized. This suite stops it
 * coming back, and stops the same shape appearing anywhere else, because the
 * next author will have no reason to know any of the above.
