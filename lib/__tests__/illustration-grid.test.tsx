/**
 * Proportion-grid conformance for the vehicle illustration set.
 *
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 *
 * Pass 1 failed its own acceptance test — at 48px, sedan / coupe / sports /
 * small SUV / wagon / generic were interchangeable — because every shape shared
 * a stance while the differences lived in detail that vanishes at that size.
 * Rev 1's answer is a shared grid of three roof heights and two clearances.
 *
 * **This file is what makes the grid load-bearing rather than documentation.**
 * It renders the real components and measures the real paths, so a future edit
 * that nudges a roofline back toward the pack fails here instead of silently
 * un-fixing the review.
