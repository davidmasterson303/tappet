 * after a screen depends on breaking it.
 *
 * **The lesson it encodes cost a real fix on 30 Jul.** `VehicleCard` queried
 * Supabase directly from the browser and deleted vehicles client-side, with no
 * server-side ownership check. Authorization lives in `lib/api-auth.ts`; a
 * client that talks to tables directly is a second answer to "who may see
 * this", and the second answer is always the one that is wrong.
 *
 * ── Why this lives in the web suite ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is a static scan of source text, so it needs no React Native runtime, no
 * jest-expo, and no second toolchain. Putting it here means it runs on every
 * `npm test` from the day the rule exists rather than from the day someone
 * configures a mobile runner. When the Expo app gets its own suite this can
 * move; until then, an unenforced rule would be worth nothing.

 * loosening**. NHTSA's vPIC is a public, unauthenticated US government API that
 * the add-a-car screen asks for model lists and VIN decodes. `apiRequest` is
 * structurally unusable for it: it prefixes `API_PREFIX`, resolves against
 * `API_BASE_URL`, and attaches a Supabase bearer token — none of which vPIC has
 * any use for, and the last of which would send a Well Kept credential to a
 * third party.
 *
 * The exception is kept safe by the case below it rather than by good
 * intentions: an exempt module that named a Well Kept path or host would be
 * exactly the hole this rule exists to close, and that is asserted separately.
 *
 * Going direct is also what keeps the feature a JS-only change. A proxy route
 * would be a new `/api/v1/*` endpoint, and per `CLAUDE.md` §8 a mobile build

      An exempt module is exempt because it talks to somebody who is not

      the app's own base URL, it has become an unauthenticated second route into
      this product's data — which is the `VehicleCard` defect at the top of this

      Two halves, and the second is the one that actually holds:

        - the exempt module names none of ours, and
        - it mints **no URL of its own at all**. Every address it fetches comes
          from `@wellkept/core/vehicle-catalog`, whose complete set of hosts is

          not do it — the hostname legitimately lives in the shared module, and
